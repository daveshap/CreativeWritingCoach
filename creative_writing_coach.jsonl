{"prompt": "**Empty Inside**\n\nKate struggled with the antiquated padlock to the factory. The key fit, but after decades of disuse the mechanism refused to budge. As she shifted her hand, looking for a better grip on the lock, the rust caught the web of her thumb and tore at the skin.\n\n\"Hell!\" She jerked away, and tried and failed to find a painless way to hold her hand. \"Worst *fricking* place for a cut,\" Kate mumbled. She'd wondered where she was going to go after this trip, and now she knew. Straight to a clinic for a tetanus booster. She eyed the padlock and considered abandoning her inheritance entirely. It wasn't like there was going to be anything valuable inside. But she'd come all the way to Detroit now, and that combined with her curiosity to make her try one more time. \n\nShe began to reach for the lock but pulled away when she saw the tiny drop of blood amidst the rust. Touching only the key, she gave it a twist to the right. This time, it turned easily, and the chain slithered out of the door handles when she lifted the lock. The rattle of the links striking the asphalt echoed between the decaying buildings, and dropping the lock provided a staccato punctuation.\n\nThe doors to the factory opened with a thunderous creak, to the chittered complaints of waking bats. Decades of shifting foundations had apparently made the doors a little bit load-bearing, and Kate winced as cracks spiderwebbed across one of the few surviving windows when she stepped inside. The evening sun and the high-set windows combined to leave the shop floor covered in shadows. Darkness loomed over everything, only the vaguest shapes visible in the gloom.\n\nKate fumbled with her phone for a flashlight as faint noises rustled in the blackness, some irrational fear crawling down her spine and finding a serious house on serious earth in her belly. *Something dwelled there*.\n\nShe released a slightly hysterical giggle when the cone of illumination revealed only a black cat, retreating to its home in the empty engine bay of a half-finished car. Sweeping her light around revealed a glimpse into history, and she was suddenly glad she'd come.\n\nGravity had done its slow work over the years, and puddles of grease lay beneath the machinery, never to be replaced. Cars in various states of manufacture and decay littered the floor. Between the broken windows of the factory and the vehicles, every one of Kate's steps was accompanied by the crunch of glass. \n\nThere were no straight lines between the workspaces, and Kate soon lost track of the entrance as she wound her way through the factory, taking pictures of the most interesting unique scenes of abandonment and dyspathy. She still jerked at unexpected sounds, and listened carefully for any that might be dangerous, even if she knew it was silly as she did so. But between her excitement and fear, she failed to keep track of her declining battery.\n\nStrangely, there was no noise the doors swung shut on their own.\n\nShe was too far away too hear when the chains crept back through the handles, and when the lock, the single drop of blood vanished, clicked itself shut.\n\nWhen the newly cracked window shattered, there was no one left to hear it.\n\nWC: 553\n\nr/NobodysGaggle\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of your story is very strong, I like the way you set the scene and introduce the protagonist. The description of the factory is also very evocative and creates a strong sense of place. However, there are a few small things you could do to improve your style.

For example, you could describe the sound of the padlock rattling, or the smell of rust and grease in the factory.\n\nYou have done a great job of creating a sense of tension and foreboding in the story. However, there are a few places where you could be more concise.

{"prompt": "\"A girl's trip\", a trip to remember--that was an understatement.\n\nStill on the high of graduating together with masters from Georgetown, best friends since preschool Cara and Ginger agreed a week-long road trip back home to Tacoma would make a welcome reward. Silently each considered it would be their last together before life took them down very different paths: Cara had a wedding to plan; Ginger would come back up from California and the job she would be starting to serve as maid of honor.\n\nDay three: destination in their GPS and let it ride, trading off driving duties. Ginger was comfortable in big cities; Cara preferred the long, lonesome stretches. The drive was relaxed; neither in a hurry for this trip to end. Ginger was moving her outstretched hand out the window in Nebraska when the music was interrupted.\n\n\"...a multi-vehicle accident in central Nebraska has both directions of I-80 backed up for fifty miles. With the forecast of high daytime temperatures with severe storms and probable tornadoes mid-afternoon officials have started running buses to evacuate stranded motorists to safety. You are advised to avoid I-80 or exit as soon as possible. Repeating...\"\n\n\"Cara, look,\" Ginger said, pointing.\n\nCara pulled them off the interstate to a small, unmaintained gravel road. Their trusty GPS seemed stuck recalculating as they followed the barely-there road slowly, the sound of heavy weeds brushing the car's underside. It seemed like hours when they rounded a corner, suddenly before an antiquated, collapsing house atop a hill.\n\n\"Whoa, a serious house on serious earth,\" Cara whispered. She stopped the car, the two girls getting out to look over a dilapidated town spread before them.\n\n\"'Welcome to Lauralton',\" Ginger read. \"Probably a company town. House probably the owners. See, there's the factory,\" she said, pointing to the far side of town. Building after building showed signs of the decay and neglect of dyspathy, many of them heaps overtaken by weeds. The burnt-out walls of the factory cast long shadows as they approached. As they drove into the shadow the car coughed once, rolling to a stop at the factory entrance.\n\n\"Dammit,\" Cara blurted, hammering the wheel.\n\n\"'S okay. Pop the hood.\" Ginger said, getting out to take a look. \n\n\"How bad?\" Cara asked, joining her as Ginger looked carefully. Ginger shook her head.\n\n\"Damn, no signal,\" Cara said.\n\n\"Me either.\" Ginger looked at the factory building's external stairs. \"Up there?\"\n\n\"On it,\" Cara replied, racing through weeds to the nearest building's stairs. At the top she checked again.\n\n\"Well?\" Ginger yelled up.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nGinger looked at the approaching clouds. \"We need cover before that storm gets here,\" she said.\n\nThe doors opened easily, the girls cautiously entering. They walked past several offices to look onto a factory floor, covered by a collapsed roof.\n\n\"What's that?\" Ginger asked, pointing at a dirty, faded but still visible mural on the far wall.\n\n\"Wow... an \"E\" Award,\" Cara whispered in awe.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"An excellence award, given for production in WWII. My great-grandma worked in a plant like this, when Grandma was an infant. Died several days after an accident there, Grandma said.\"\n\nGinger shivered, feeling the temperature drop, the wind picking up. \"I need to pee...\"\n\n\"You go that way. If you find a bathroom, yell.\" Cara said.\n\nGinger walked into a hallway past several doors, looking inside. Her scream brought Cara running.\n\n\"What?!?\"\n\n\"There's someone in there\" Ginger said, shaking.\n\nCara carefully inched the door open, looking at a dirty mirror in the light of a small window. \"No one there. I can stand guard if you still need to pee.\"\n\n\"Nope, 'M good.\" Ginger snapped.\n\n\"I saw a display when you screamed I want to go back to.\"\n\nTogether the girls went back to the display, a large, fading group photo the centerpiece.\n\n\"Lauralton Aviation. Why does that sound familiar?\" Cara pondered.\n\n\"Cara, I don't like this place.\" Ginger said, squinting at the picture. \"Hey, that could be you,\" she said, pointing. \"Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Go see if it'll crank now--here's the keys. I'll be right out--give me ten more minutes to look around. Hit the horn if I'm not out,\" Cara said as she looked closer at the picture. \n\nCara heard Ginger racing down the steps. \"Great-grandm...?\" she asked rhetorically. Turning around she looked into the same eyes that peered up from the photo, her mirror image. She blinked, now nothing in front of her but disturbed dust.\n\n-----\n\nDarkness loomed over everything. As the car roared to life Cara jumped into the passenger's seat, out of breath. \"Go, go, go!\" she yelled, slapping the dashboard.\n\nHeadlights on, Ginger floored it for the approaching storm, their dust drifting toward the factory.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Something... something dwells there,\" Cara mumbled, wrapping her arms close.\n\n\n-----\n\n(Word count: 800.

However, the story quickly loses momentum in the middle and becomes quite confusing.

{"prompt": "#Genreic Shift\n\nPart 4\n\nGenrene had just managed to climb a tree before a figure stumbled out of the shadows. Cyrus hobbled towards the statue and promptly fell to his knees before it. He was covered in blood, more than Genrene knew that could come from only two men. No, another cluster of his once-loyal men had chased him too. Where were they now? Likely dead at his first mate\u2019s hands.\n\nGenrene\u2019s thoughts quickly went blank though and his eyes widened as the spectacle of the statue before him turned. Turned? No, as it corrupted. Sure, it became a rusted brown first, as if it were a giant slab of iron left out in the rain for centuries, but as he watched, the land around him turned too.\n\n\u201cMy servant,\u201d the entity rumbled. \u201cRise Cyrus, for there is work to be done. This isle you stand upon is one a part of the forgotten lands. Of antiquated civilisations made from metals long lost to decay. Now, my child of doom, you shall be used as a vessel to spread dyspathy and shadow beyond your realm.\u201d\n\nGenrene was confused for a moment. Why would a creature such as this explain its plan to its own mindless servant? Why bother with the monologue? Genrene\u2019s answer came quickly and shocked him to his core.\n\nThere, on closer inspection, he saw Cyrus struggle and writhe on the ground. All around him, the rust grew and consumed all. But not just simple rust born of water, no. Something dwelled there and darkness loomed over everything.\n\n\u201cDo you accept your place, my servant?\u201d the statue boomed.\n\n\u201cYeeeesss,\u201d Cyrus hissed through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cGood. The god of gods created us to end the world many centuries ago, and still, humanity has held out. We were made in the likeness of a scourge to wipe out all of Pandora\u2019s children. And so we will.\u201d\n\nCyrus continued to writhe on the ground but Genrene remained still, not daring to give in to the hope that his most trusted friend still remained.\n\n\u201cI have one last task for you, my servant. End your captain in the trees. And do not let him stop the ship. Despite what he might try, I fear it is too late for him, but I must remain certain.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, the darkness left.\n\nRust still remained instilled deep into the ground. Perhaps Genrene was so caught up by the haunting spirit or that it knew of his presence, but he hadn\u2019t noticed when the land around him changed.\n\nThe island wasn't of dark forests and stone-peaked mountains anymore. When Genrene looked up from Cyrus\u2019 now prone form, he was left breathless at the visage of a ruined civilisation. Buildings rose high around him, coloured with the same rust as he\u2019d seen before. The green forest underbrush now gave way to cracked and uncared for roads. Rust flaked everything and everywhere.\n\n\u2018But how was this?\u2019 Genrene thought. \u2018Buildings made of metal rather than wood? Giant structures taller than should be possible?\u2019\n\n\"A Serious house on serious earth,\" he whispered. An old saying that meant nonsense.\n\nGenrene didn\u2019t look back from the mesmerising structures around him until he felt the trunk of his lone tree sway. Before he was given an opportunity to look down though, he stumbled and half slid half fell to the ground. He knew who had done it before he even saw him.\n\nCyrus stood over him, teeth bared and rusted needle-like blade pointed threateningly toward him. Genrene unsheathed his own cutlass and the dance of steel began.\n\nSilver met brown and flakes of both flew in all directions. Genrene\u2019s blade was heavier and less sharp but was also stronger. Even so, the first blow took him by surprise and he threw himself back as the point jabbed at his side.\n\nCyrus dove forward, allowing his blood lust to drive him into a reckless attack. Though Genrene wasn't expecting such a brutal attack, he managed to expertly dodge the blow by jumping aside and plunged his own blade into his first mate\u2019s back. The steel quivered there for a second and his friend tried to rise from the wound but could not.\n\nGenrene marvelled at his own luck before remembering that the man lying before him had taken on a group of men before this and had won.\n\nGenrene thought to win his friend back with words but his mouth dried up and his throat tightened. And so, call it cowardice if you must, but he raised the cutlass once more and dealt the final blow before charging off away from the cursed abandoned town.\n\nMerely moments later, an exhausted flustered Genrene stood on the beach. He doubled over and breathed heavily as his beloved ship, The Genre, sailed further away, now just a misty shadow.\n\n***\n\nWc: 800\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed was that you have a great eye for detail. You did a great job of setting the scene and making the reader feel like they were there.

{"prompt": "The command had been issued. The room was suddenly quiet. Alan became aware of every breath he took. Each tick of the grandfather clock, a thunderclap. He looked across the table at his father, old and grey. He knew this was his destiny, but so soon? He tried to resist.\n\n\n\"I don't even have kids, Dad,\" Alan spoke. He stared at his old man's face, looking for a reaction. None came, so he continued. \"It wouldn't make sense for me to take on your role. How could Father Time not be a father? Can't it wait? Clarissa and I have been trying, actually\u2014for kids, I mean\u2014but still no luck. It just doesn't seem right. I don't think I'm ready yet.\"\n\n\nHe finished speaking, though he had a million other things to say. He knew it wouldn't have mattered. His father shook his head.\n\n\n\"I'm too old,\" his father said with the same stoic tone Alan had known since childhood. \"The burdens of time are too heavy now. I know you're nervous, but this is something you can't be ready for. You just have to jump in. Now take my hand.\"\n\n\nAlan wanted to run. He looked out the windows of the house, into the empty void where time and space didn't exist. It was to become his home. He did as he was told.\n\n\nHis father's hands were cold. Alan hated how bony they were. *This is going to happen to me*, he thought to himself, and frowned. In comparison, his own hands were substantial, full of life, and warm. Even more sad, he remembered when his dad's hands had been like that too. The price of being Father Time was costly.\n\n\n\"It's going to get better,\" his father said. Alan looked into his cold, blue eyes. \"At first it's hard, but it does get easier, trust me. Good luck, son. I know you'll make me proud.\"\n\n\nAlan almost let go of his father's hands. Not because he was scared of the future, but because he was shocked by the words. Not once in thirty years had his father said something like that. It was always an order, or a reprimanding. Even at Alan's wedding, his father had refused to say more than a handful of cheap remarks.\n\n\nAnd then, he disappeared. The man known as Father Time left existence. Or, better to say, he was reincarnated. A title passed down from father to son.\n\n\nThe silence was broken by a raging scream. The old wooden chair Alan was sitting on crashed sideways against the floor, propelled by Alan's writhing in pain. The floor was cold against his body. He squeezed his forehead, hoping to make the hurting stop, as the entirety of the universe became aware of him, and him aware of it. Every single moment, every memory, ever, entered his mind. His brain couldn't handle the flood of information and emotion. After he could scream no more, he passed out. The grandfather clock ticked away in silence once again.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nClarissa cried. \"You should be happy,\" she said to the husk of the man sitting across the table. \"We've been trying for so long. Finally I'm pregnant.\" She had hoped this would be the one thing to break Alan out of, what he called, 'temporal apathy', but it seemed it wasn't so. He was as emotionless as ever.\n\n\n\"I am happy,\" he said, without a smile, or a frown, or any change in facial expression really. \"How many times must I say it?\"\n\n\n\"You're not happy! Look at you! Couldn't you at least try to look happy? Fake a smile? Anything? Please.\"\n\n\nHis wife's cries had little effect on Alan. Ever since he had shouldered the weight of time, he had become emotionally shutoff. It was a natural response to feeling every emotion ever, all the time, all at once. The human body adapts.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry love, I really am,\" Alan said, trying his hardest to sound remorseful, but failing, \"you know it's hard for me.\" \n\n\nThe truth of it was that Alan already knew all about their child. He knew they'd name him Caleb, and that he'd like soccer, and that he'd get drunk for the first time at fifteen at a house party, and that he'd steal money from them, and that he'd marry at 18, divorce at 20, remarry the same girl at 22, and divorce for good at 26. He knew everything. And, just like Alan, his son would try to run from becoming Father Time, failing. With a sigh, he took his wife's hands in his and tried his best to console her. Just going through the motions seemed to be enough.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAlan was reading a book when Clarissa walked in. He looked up with the same expression he always had on. \n\n\n\"It's happening,\" she said. \"My water's broke.\"\n\n\nThey drove to the hospital, exchanging minimal words. After getting checked in and a bed, the two waited. Clarissa was in labor for 20 hours. Alan sat with her the entire time, even though it was just physically. It was the least, and most, he could do. Caleb Martin Time came in at a healthy weight of 7 pounds 4 ounces. He was unusually silent for a newborn, and after the doctor decided the baby was fine, he let the mother hold him. \n\n\n\"Look, dear,\" she said to Alan, \"he has your eyes. Beautiful and blue.\" \n\n\nAlan looked at his son, feeling like he'd already done it all before. Everything in him was just a whirlwind of memories. Clarissa held the baby out. Alan tilted his head to the side.\n\n\n\"Don't you want to hold your son?\" she asked.\n\n\n\"Oh, right,\" Alan said, as he took the baby into his arms.\n\n\nEverything began to slow down.\n\n\nFor the first time in forever, Alan was present there, in that moment. The tornado of time he was always stuck inside paused. He looked down at the baby, *his* baby, in his arms. Clarissa couldn't help but smile as she saw something she hadn't in a long time. A tear rolled down Alan's cheek as the temporal apathy melted away. He put on a smile, not the one he used to have, back before he had shouldered the burdens of time, but one that was new, and trying, and promised to grow with each passing second. Clarissa looked up at her husband, and, by the expression on his face, she knew he was returning. Not fully back yet, no, but on the train home. She didn't know how long it would take for him to fully arrive, but she promised to the three of them that she'd be there, waiting at the station. \n\n\n\"Hi, little guy,\" Alan said, testing out his new smile, brushing his baby's thin hair, and wishing his own father was there to see it all.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The command had been issued.

I'm intrigued to find out more about this character and their unique situation.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where your story could be further polished. First, watch out for awkward phrases like \"the screams of the people around me as they were consumed by fire.\" A smoother way to phrase this would be something like \"the screams of the people around me as the flames consumed them.\"\n\nSecond, be careful of using too many clich\u00e9s. For example, the phrase \"one small conversation at a time\" is a bit overused and could be replaced with something more original.\n\nFinally, watch your grammar and punctuation.

{"prompt": "Several times, travelers made complaints about the suspicious Eridanian from System HD265-T3 skulking around the exit of Gate E3.  Arrival flights from Earth disembarked their passengers here, each of them in a rush to meet connecting flights. The Eridanian, known professionally as \u2018K\u2019, knew he was untouchable. Countless bribes over the past cycle had ensured that he and his partner, \u2018G\u2019, could work free from the interference of flight security.\n\nNearby drones announced the arrival of Flight 2938 at Gate E3. K imagined that he was an ancient Terran predator as he observed the herd of masked humans pour out of the gate. He scanned each of them individually, the processing power of his advanced mind allowing for minute details to be observed within nanoseconds. He felt a pronounced sense of superiority as he watched them scramble, some obviously new to wearing the bulky, uncomfortable masks. His observations were immediately transponded to G. \n\n*An old woman. Slow. Easy. Family too large.*\n\n*Child. Too noisy.* \n\n*Paired mates. One making their way to restroom. Too risky, partner may return early.* \n\n*Another old one. Assisted transportation through spaceport. Too much oversight.*\n\n\n\tAs the rush of passengers in the terminal died down, K worried that this flight would be another dud. Just as he felt ready to give up, one last straggler made their way out of the gate. K immediately went to transponding. \n\n\n\t*Last passenger. Indeterminate gender. One bad leg. Alone. Terminal mostly empty.  Seems unfamiliar with spaceport layout. This is the one.*\n\n\n\tAcross the room, G approached the target, taking the form of an old Terran spaceport attendant. The hum of kind words and friendly gestures echoed across the vacant terminal. K appreciated G\u2019s approach to abducting the targets. Fear had a way of ruining the goods if applied too early. No, they needed to be comfortable if their product\u2019s purity was to be maintained. Purer product would lead to better highs in their customers.\n\n\n\tNow, the target followed G towards K\u2019s location. He wondered what the lie was this time. Usually, they were told that they\u2019d be assisted through the spaceport, they only needed to check in over there, in the side room used for new passenger processing. In reality, the room had been rented with the same bribes that kept flight security away. K opened the door as they approached. G, keeping to his polite disguise, gave an \u2018after you\u2019 to the passenger, who entered first. The professionals followed, sealing the door behind them.\n\n\n\tFear was appropriate now. The process went formulaically: the target realized that the empty room was a trap, and begin to panic, beginning the production of fluids. G resumed his natural form, with all its tentacles, and held the prey down, allowing K to inject the target with a drug that would induce an elevated stress response, ensuring enough fluids were produced. K left the terrified, squirming target\u2019s mask on. It would catch the tears for him, making collection easier. \n\n\n\tThe Eridanian waited in the corner of the room, letting the injection work as G continued holding down the target. He prepped the vial for collection, and strode back over to the target, who was now still. K pulled the mask off, holding the vial low, ready to the most difficult portion of the human\u2019s fluid.

{"prompt": "It was all a bit confusing, to say the least. I didn't know what to make of it. I spent most of my days wandering around the gorgeous Colorado landscape, trying not to think too much about it all. It wasn't until I found myself at a local coffee shop that I started to feel a bit more at home.\n\n\n\nI sat down in the corner of the coffee shop, my fingers curling around my coffee mug and giving it a squeeze. It was soothing, having something to hold onto.\n\n\n\n\"Hey,\" a voice said suddenly. I looked up to see a girl, probably around my age - or a least the age I appeared to be-, with curly brown hair and a wide smile. \"I'm Madison,\" she said, and held out her hand.\n\n\n\nI smiled back at her and shook her hand. \"I'm Lueius,\" I said.\n\n\n\n\"Well, Lueius,\" Madison said, \"can I get you anything else?\"\n\n\n\n\"No, I'm okay,\" I said. \"Just enjoying my coffee.\"\n\n\n\n\"You got it,\" Madison said, and went off to help another customer.\n\n\n\nI turned back to my coffee and took another sip. It was strong and bitter, just the way I liked it. It tasted good. I was enjoying it while it lasted, because it wouldn't be long before my time in Colorado would come to an end.\n\n\n\nIt was inevitable. At some point, one of the humans would start to wonder why I didn't age. \n\n\n\n\"Do you have time to talk?\"\n\n\n\nI looked up to see a girl standing in front of my table. She was slender, but had a powerful presence about her. She had long black hair, which she had tied behind her head, and there was a tiny smile on her lips.\n\n\n\nI gestured to the chair across from me. \"Please,\" I said.\n\n\n\nShe sat down. She crossed her legs and smiled with her teeth. She looked around the coffee shop, and then she looked back at me. Her eyes were the most fascinating shade of green I'd ever seen. They glimmered with curiosity.\n\n\n\n\"You're not from around here,\" she said. It wasn't a question.\n\n\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" I asked.\n\n\n\n\"You're not a tourist,\" she said. \"Not with that outfit. But you're not from around here, either. You're not a local.

I held my hands over my face, blocking out the light from the hall.\n\n\n\n\"Son?\" My father's voice sounded concerned. \"Are you okay? What's going on?\"\n\n\n\nI felt my father sit on the edge of my bed. He put a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n\n\"What's going on, son?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not your son,\" I said, and shoved my father's hand off my shoulder. He was taken aback by my brusque manner.\n\n\n\n\"Why are you acting like this?\" he asked. \"Is there something wrong? Why are you saying these things? Didn't you have a nice time with your mother and me yesterday? We took you out to dinner. We took you to the movies.

{"prompt": "I was naive to think that lives could only be saved through healing and to think healing was a noble art.\n  \n\n  \nEver since I was a child, I wanted to save lives. I grew up at the wrong time. Before I could learn healing magic, many healing temples had been put under scrutiny by the government. Healing had been used for evil.\n  \n\n  \nThe most feared mage in the land was not a pyromancer, nor a necromancer, but a healer. He regenerated parts of the body to the point of excess, causing malignant growths and cancers. He had a hoard of prisoners which he kept alive for harvesting, removing their organs, and regrowing them over and over. He multiplied invasive plants to ruin harvests, was a master of pain, and had become a message for others not to underestimate healers.\n  \n\n  \nOne day, my future was bright, the next, it was all but a fantasy. I could not learn healing magic, but I promised myself that I would find a way to help people.\n  \n\n  \nFew forms of magic lend themselves well for healing. Not charms, transfiguration, or energy manipulation. But death\u2026 death was the opposite school of magic of life. I soon realized they were one of the same. It was the only type of magic I hadn\u2019t tried, the moment I cast my first death spell, I could feel the reversal of life magic, the same magic twisted to its corrupted counterpart. If a healer could harm, perhaps a death mage could heal.\n  \n\n  \nSpells meant to share pain between two people could also be used to share healing. Spells meant to kill warriors could also be used to kill diseases. Spells meant to manipulate spirits could be used to help them find peace. Finally, I had found a way to save lives.\n  \n\n  \nThough in recent days the most feared healer has been increasing their carnage. All of my spellwork has been simply to try to undo his vile deeds. I must wipe out the source of this hurt. So now, I stand before the dark healer\u2019s tower, prepared to use death magic to snuff out life. I will heal this land by curing it of its plagues.

The reward for the princess is enough to fuel my drinks for the next year.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you care about? Have you no pride, sir knight? You are meant to be a glimmer of hope.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou expect me to work for free? Like those little peasants that toil away in the farmlands only to die from whatever rotten disease plagues our kingdom? I\u2019m a knight. Nothing honorable about serving a king. Are we fighting or not? Last chance to decide.\u201d\n\n \n\nMarvin looked at his two accomplices. Brandon gave a confident nod, even while his small body shook, unable to hide his nerves. Trisha took a step forward, circling around the knight, preparing to get behind him when the battle took place. With the two having prepared for their fates, Marvin went to reach for the dagger, only to get startled by a scream.\n\n \n\n\u201cDON\u2019T TOUCH THAT! HE WILL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF AS SOON AS YOU BEND DOWN.\u201d\n\n \n\nWhen Marvin pulled his head away, he would see the sword of the knight hovering overhead. Had he kept his head down any longer, it would be rolling on the floor by his feet. Trisha had tried to stop the attack, but her blade had only dented the back armor of the knight, unable to cut through. Galden returned his blade to its sheath, raising a hand towards Trisha, warning her to halt from any further attacks.\n\n\u201cPrincess? I don\u2019t approve of you warning your kidnappers about my attack. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I would think you were hoping I would die in this encounter.\u201d \n\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t die. Steel plate armor like yours can sustain such attacks. I was just hoping they might have given you a few knocks over your head before I needed to reveal myself.\u201d She gave a mocking curtsy to Galden, collecting the dagger as she did.\n\n \n\n\u201cCome on, I don\u2019t know what this is and I don\u2019t care. Even if you got yourself kidnapped on purpose, it hardly matters. I have a job to do, so you can either come along quietly or I\u2019ll drag you back over my shoulder. If you pick the second choice, I will smack you against every tree branch on the way home.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou will do no such thing to our lady.\u201d Trisha said, stepping forward, only for Galden to look back in her direction, squinting at her through the eyehole in his helmet.\n\n \n\n\u201cYour lady? What sort of kidnappers are you people? Ok, what\u2019s going on princess? You haven\u2019t got a scratch on you, so it\u2019s clear that you planned this. I\u2019m just curious as to why. Is this some sort of royal tamper tantrum?\u201d Galden heard a heavy step, glancing Trisha\u2019s way. \u201cYou try anything, and I will kill you.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cTrisha, it\u2019s ok. For his many faults, Galden has been decent to me. He isn\u2019t part of the ploy to kill me. Not even those that lurk in the castle\u2019s shadows would trust him enough for a job like that. Isn\u2019t that right, the disgrace of Feldindall?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cDisgrace? It\u2019s rich calling me a disgrace when your daddy sends me to do his dirty work. Are you forgetting who watched over you, brat?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNot at all. Which is why I am giving you a chance to do something right for once. There\u2019s a cult after me, one hiding in the castle\u2019s walls.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAh, huh? There\u2019s always a cult, princess. Cults are a common part of life. I\u2019ve killed hundreds of cult members. They are just going to be a threat that you must get used to. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. These cults aren\u2019t like the others. They have members with these weird glowing blue eyes. I saw one roaming the halls at night. It would have spotted me if I didn\u2019t dive underneath the dining table.\u201d Brandon said, grabbing the arm of Galden, only to receive a hard smack across the face for it. Galden\u2019s gauntlet connecting with his cheek, sending him to the floor.\n\n  \n\u201cAnd what were you doing near the dining table?\u201d Galden went to grab his sword, only for Trisha and Marvin to step forward, blocking his access to the downed man. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting a thief.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cFormer thief. He was the one that convinced the others to warn me about the plan.\u201d Alisa stepped forward, pulling up the sleeve of her long, flowing white dress before she smacked the side of his helmet with his dagger\u2019s handle, sending a rattling through the metal. She tightly gripped the dagger after it, hoping the strike had delivered its intended message.\n\n \n\n\u201cTry harder next time if you want to do some damage, princess. Most people won\u2019t just stand there after you hit them.\u201d Despite his words, Galden rested a hand on the side of his head, adjusting the helmet so it was sitting upright once more. The rattling had caused a throbbing sensation to flow through his head, only for it to settle down after a few seconds. \n\n \n\n\u201cShut up and listen. If you don\u2019t believe them, believe me. I saw the man they were talking about. He tried to break into my room. If those three weren\u2019t there to distract him, he would have killed me. They distracted him long enough for the guards to come running. I didn\u2019t plan to stick around long enough for the cult to find out they failed, which is why I escaped with them. But if you tracked me, that must mean the cult will follow soon.\u201d Alisa said her piece, watching as Galden slipped off his helmet. The worn-down man underneath letting out a sigh, dragging his fingers against his dirty stubble.\n\n \n\n\u201cA cult with blue eyes? They aren\u2019t demon worshippers then. Demons use blood, which tends to dye things red. Are you certain this isn\u2019t a childish fantasy of yours?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cStay with us and see. If no one comes by tomorrow morning, I will return with you to the king, no questions asked. If someone does come, you will protect us, like a knight is supposed to.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOr I can just drag you by your ankle back home? Did you consider that, princess?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI did. Do you believe I would make the journey pleasant for you? I will run off whenever I get the chance. Not to mention I\u2019ll bite, kick, and scratch at your eyes to get free. Can you withstand that for three days of travelling?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cFine, if no one shows up by tomorrow morning, we go.\u201d Galden said, placing his helmet on the floor as he found a chair to slouch against in the small cottage they were hiding in.\n\n  \n\u201cThank you. Everyone, this is Galden. I suggest ignoring him unless you see something dangerous. He hates being called the disgrace of Feldindall. So feel free to call him that.\u201d Alisa said.\n\n \n\n\u201cI suggest not calling me that. You are a princess and I will tolerate you saying it. I don\u2019t extent that tolerance to your thief friends.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAcknowledged.\u201d Marvin said, giving the knight a nod. \u201cSorry for any trouble. We want the best for her.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother, he\u2019s just a knight. We have more honor than him and we rob people. Look what he did to Brandon.\u201d Trisha added, giving his helmet a kick across the floor.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m alright. I just didn\u2019t expect the hit, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not his fault. The other knights would have done far worse if they knew I was a thief. It\u2019s nice to have someone that can fight here. Maybe I\u2019ll get some sleep tonight.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cRight, well, I can\u2019t wait to see this blue-eyed cultist that has you all worked up. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll see a blue-eyed dragon too? Or a hare? I\u2019m sure I can imagine things too.\u201d Despite his dismissive words, he couldn\u2019t help but be interested in what the princess saw. He couldn\u2019t trust thieves but the princess. She rarely lied about things, which was slightly unsettling.\n\n \n\nLeaving him alone, the others went about cooking, cleaning or lounging around the cottage, leaving Galden to just slouch in his seat, watching as they all moved around. Galden, not in the mood to talk to anyone. Instead, he kept his eyes on his surroundings, waiting for either morning or a sign of the cultist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of your story is strong, you immediately introduce the conflict and the characters.

{"prompt": "With the sudden and indeed quite violent in some cases return of magic across the globe you may suddenly find people close to you, friends, family or otherwise, developing powers beyond mortal reckoning. Siblings in particular are a tough case due to the natural tendency of magic to follow old mythical archetypes, manipulating and escalate sibling rivalries with sometimes fatal results. This Archetypal Personality Corruption Disorder(APCD) may seem to be a force beyond human ability to defeat but it is in function a mental illness which can have its worst impacts mitigated by a solid support network for the afflicted and proper understanding of the disorder and the circumstances of the afflicted. It is important to note however no matter how terrifying a witch's control over reality is or how much they may seem to be different from who they once were they are at their core the same sister or in very rare instances brother they were before, and so long as you don't let the mind clouding effects of magic make you forget that you will find it shockingly simple to settle into this new life. Still, some things are to be kept in mind to prevent possible archetypal escalation and generally survive a hectic new existence, which this guide should hopefully lay out in a helpful step by step manner.\n\n1. Never let your sibling feel alone\n\nWitches are often warped by societal isolation and exclusion, the archetype preys on this, fuelling the fears of others while fostering the flames of resentment within the young witch. Unfortunately one of the first people affected by the onset of the archetype are the parents, who in many cases die, are made forever oblivious to the plight of their child beyond reason or are otherwise forced to be absent, as a sibling however you have much more leeway in this situation. Make sure to remind them that they are loved, that even with their new power they are human and do not deserve to be alone, remind them that they are not alone and already the archetype has lost vital ground which it would have otherwise rooted so thoroughly it would be nigh impossible to remove.\n\n2.  Support their exploration of magical abilities, but make sure they don't go too far\n\nWitches have a natural impulse to explore their new powers, and this can lead to wonderful new discoveries that can benefit many as well as preventing the archetype from rooting in the anxieties and turmoil born from repression. Still overindulging in magic can also lead to the archetype taking root in the form of an unstoppable madness or mania, ethics and any other previous boundaries thrown aside in the pursuit of arcane knowledge. It is important to let your sibling understand the full depth and potential of their powers but you must be vigilant for signs they are going too far. Are they asking for live test subjects? Have they suddenly become closed off about the nature of their projects? Have they been sneaking away to places where they are not easily supervised? If any of these behaviours or other similar sudden changes are observed be sure to communicate with them on the risk of overindulging in magic and what other, safer and saner means of indulging their curiosity may exist. \n\n3. Tell them of any changes you are experiencing\n\nInevitably the archetype will attempt to take root in those close to the original magic user, which often first manifests in close siblings. If you gain sudden knowledge of swordplay, a desire to go adventuring and a change in your regular emotional state be open about these changes with your sibling and others you care about, and if they believe you are changing in a way you are not noticing ensure you do not brush it off or ignore the warning and instead set aside time to have an open discussion on the subject immediately. With any luck you would be able to escape an archetype that would force you into conflict with witches and prevent the archetype of your sibling from flaring up in turn.\n\n4. Do not be afraid to seek aid\n\nOften times the changes brought forth by magic or related archetype are beyond your ability to counteract on your own, this is fine, you are only human after all. Many services exist to help with severe instances of ACPD such as the Royal Healer Guild, Covens against Corruption and your local branch of the Posthuman Support Services which provide many treatments, support, guidance and in extremely severe cases medicinal treatments for ACPD. This is not a full substitute for a healthy home environment and local support network but provides vital aid where you inevitably will be unable to fully provide it on your own. Remember, you are not alone no matter what the story says you should be.\n\n5. Remember who your sibling really is\n\nIt can be easy to forget that the nascent witch is the same person they once were, but no matter what the archetype does to them it cannot change the fundamentals of their being, it can at most warp and distort. It must be emphasised that your sibling is still the person they always were, they are not fragile broken souls made of glass, they are not monsters restrained by a human facade and they are not any more blessed, cursed, forsaken or exalted than anyone else. Show that you love them by providing the support they need through their difficult condition but do not let this change how you normally think or interact with them, cherish them but do not suffocate them, be wary of the potential dangers they can fall into but do not fear them, do not think of them as the witch but as your sibling. This is how you truly beat the archetype, do not let the storytellers win, the ultimate subversion is treating the witch like a real person.\n\nRemember this guide and soon you will find the archetype loosening after only a few months. Witches are often seen as monstrous and inhuman, hiding away from society to sling curses and brew terrible concoctions until slain by a worthy hero, however once the archetype fails to take hold they are more or less normal people with a little more power over the magical than usual. Good luck reader, may it be better than mine at least.\n\n\\- Excerpt of The Modern Supernatural by John Pilgrim, First of the Archetype Heroic, first Witchslayer, founder of Posthuman Support Services\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your storyhooks the reader and makes them want to read more.

He would rely on formalities to maintain his composure. \n\n\u201cJim, our first question will be the most important. Humanity has long searched for meaning and order. In the many ruins of their civilization, the Precursors hinted at some pattern, a code, some great Logic that the Universe itself subsists on. Truly, the Precursors must have used the logic to control this universe, to aid in their own proliferation. The torch has been passed to us, and now we petition you, Jim, the Great Remnant of the Precursors. Everything we\u2019ve translated has indicated that -you- are the Logic that the universe runs on. We've sought you that we may act as the caretakers of this vast existence.\u201d\n\nThe many lights on Jim\u2019s sensors danced across his front panels for a moment, blending with the reflection of the millions of stars that the comet sped past.

Jim's sensors eventually stopped blinking. The lonely reflection of the galaxy was all that remained. Finally, the AI answered.\n\n\u201cMeaning? Order? What?

She complied and succeeded far beyond anyone else to do everything in her contract.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she got the documents and the food placed on my desk, I stared at it all in awe, and then shifted my gaze at her.\n\n\"I don't understand how you do it... Morgana.\"\n\n\"Do what, boss?\"\n\n\"Get here on time every single day. You never leave earlier or later than 5pm yet your work is... always finished.\"\n\n\"It's in my contract sir. It's what I do.\"\n\n\"But you do it so well. It's kind of magical really.\"\n\nMorgan raised one of her eyebrows and I suddenly felt a rush. A strange sensation washed over me as she walked towards me.\n\n\"I don't comply *so well*, sir. I do it **to the letter**. I take contracts very seriously.\"\n\n\"I can tell, maybe we should update your contract to give you some more things to do, huh? Add a little extra so we have our best worker on more projects.\"\n\n\"I believe I'm okay with the level of authority and involvement I have here, sir. I rather not get a managerial position. I'm afraid the power gets to my head and I am not *myself*.\"\n\n\"If you say so... but, you have to promise me something,\" I extended my hand towards her, and she looked at it with a hint of mischief that I didn't understand. \"you can only leave if I'm gone too, deal?\"\n\nShe smirked, taking my hand into her own.\n\n\"It's a deal. Signed and bonded, but you should probably be more specific next time, eh boss?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I should have known that something was wrong. She looked too much like some of the original workers, and it didn't make sense that 5 generations had worked with us by now. \n\nIn hindsight, I should have been more specific with what I meant as I said she could leave once I was **gone**. And, maybe, I should have realized the importance of promises earlier, as I slowly felt myself drift away, she caressed my cheek. \n\n\"Thanks, boss.

I like the detail about the clock striking 9am sharp. However, the fourth paragraph feels a bit contrived and could be rewritten to flow better. For example, you could describe the protagonist's reaction to the food and copies in more detail.\n\nThe fifth paragraph is well written and furthers the plot.

{"prompt": "I told her not to go outside, not in broad daylight. But Miri had wanted to see the sun. And they'd gotten to her.\n\nI woke that morning to find her gone, and I panicked. I ran to the foyer of the building we'd been hiding in, and I saw her standing there.\n\nShe looked normal, just like she always did. But I knew something was wrong. I ran to her. I could tell she wasn't moving, not even breathing, even though she was still standing up. I extended a trembling hand to touch her arm, dreading what I'd find.\n\nMy fingertips came away with a thin coating of flesh-colored frosting.\n\nMy wife had become *a cake.*\n\nAt first we had thought it was whimsical. It was cute. Look a can of coke -- wait, no, it's a cake! Look, a brand-new PS5! Ha, wrong! It's a *cake!* Realistic cakes were everywhere, on social media.\n\nAnd then, one day, they were just everywhere, *period.*\n\nIn the beginning, it had just seemed like really fast and extremely skilled acts of baking and legerdemain. People thought they must be some sort of guerilla street artists, trying to say something profound about society by replacing everyday objects with perfect cake-based facsimiles.\n\nTheir creations were indistinguishable from the real thing until you touched them, and then they were revealed as superficial shells of frosting and fondant concealing the truth of soft spongy cake in a variety of flavors.\n\nBut then, it started happening to animals. It even started happening to people. Cut into one of these animal or person-cakes, and you'd see the whole body rendered in cake, in perfect detail, with white sponge for bone, and different shades of red velvet for muscles and organs. These were no mere bakery creations. These were living beings, our pets, our friends, and even our families, *transmuted* into cakes.\n\nSoon after, the Cake Cultists revealed themselves, announcing their existence to the world, along with the fact that they had members placed in the highest ranks of government, industry, and the military. They appeared on every screen -- or at least those that hadn't already been turned to cake -- announcing their goal: in service to their dark master, an entity whom they called \"The Cake of Infinite Tiers\" they would turn the whole world and everyone in it, into *cake.*\n\nI dropped to my knees beside my beloved Miri, now just a cake. I wanted to hold her, but I couldn't bear the thought of her cake body crumbling in my arms, or my hot tears dissolving her frosting and fondant flesh. So I just knelt beside her, and wept.\n\nThen I heard the footsteps. I looked up, and I saw them, walking in through the glass doors that led outside.\n\nCake Cultists, three of them. Each wore a long dark robe, and a mask like a black, multi-tiered wedding cake. Overcome with grief and rage, I struggled to my feet, clenching my fists in hopeless fury.\n\n\"Do it! Do it, you sons of bitches! I don't care anymore! Get it over with, you bastards!\" I screamed.\n\nThe Cultists looked at each other, and then the middle cultist stepped forward. He extended his hand towards me. I felt a tingling, as I began to change...\n\nSuddenly, a black Dodge Challenger smashed in through the glass door, and rammed right into the middle cultist, who screamed as he was slammed to ground and then crushed beneath the front tires.\n\nA figure in a hooded leather jacket leaped out of the driver's seat of the car. The two remaining Cultists faced off against him, each extending an arm towards the new arrival. Before they could work their dark transmutation upon him, he extended an open hand towards each of them, and slowly began to close his fists.\n\nThe Cultists began to writhe and scream, clawing at their Cake-masks, which were crumpling in on themselves, getting smaller and smaller. I looked away in horror before I saw how it ended. I just heard two sickening, cracking, squelching noises, and then the sound of two bodies hitting the foyer floor.\n\nI looked fearfully up at the stranger, his face hidden in his dark hood. He approached me, and extended his hand in my direction.\n\n\"Wait, I'm not with them, I--\" I began, stammering. Then I realized he wasn't pointing his hand at me. He was pointing it at Miri.\n\nMy eyes widened, as the air around the cake that had been my wife rippled with some unseen force. The fingerprints on her arm where I'd marred her frosting vanished. There was no visible change beyond that, for the cake facsimiles were always perfect visual copies, but suddenly Miri was collapsing to the floor, gasping. She was flesh and blood again.\n\nI cried out in wonder and relief, rushing to embrace her, pulling her close to me as she slowly regained her senses. Tearfully, I looked up at the stranger.\n\n\"Thank you! Thank God for you! How....how did you do that? Who are you?\" I stammered in amazement.\n\nHe pulled back his hood, revealing a the face of a middle aged man with dark hair, and olive skin.\n\n\"The Cake Cultists have defiled that which I hold most sacred.\" he said, an undercurrent of passion and anger in his voice. \"I'm building an army to stop them.\"\n\nHe extended a hand each to  Miri and I to help us up. We took them, rising to stand before him. He smiled at us, warmly.\n\n\"My name is Bartolo Valastro Jr. But people call me *The Cake Boss.\"*\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " First, I want to commend you on writing a story that is both original and horrifying. The concept of the Cake Cultists is both intriguing and disturbing, and I think you did a great job of conveying the fear and confusion that would come with such a situation.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where I think you could improve. First, I think you could be more concise in your writing. There are a few areas where you go into too much detail, or where you could tighten up your prose. For example, in the second paragraph, you could cut out some of the details about the different types of cakes, and focus more on the reaction of the characters.\n\nSecond, I think you could work on your dialogue. In some places, it feels stiff and unnatural. Again, in the second paragraph, the dialogue between the cultists feels very stilted.

{"prompt": "My genetic divergence has been a pain in the ass, until now.\n  \n\n  \nI have a very acute sense of smell. Out of all the senses to have an enhanced version of, smell has got to be the worst. I can smell body odor from across the street. I always know who dealt with it. There is no escape from the rancid stench of the world. Every hazy cigar cloud, every particle of smog in the air, and every cheap ass perfume. \n  \n\n  \nBut, you ask, what about good smells, like food or flowers? First off, it's not like I smell them when I want to. Do you want to smell someone\u2019s eggs benedict while eating dessert? No, the smell utterly overpowers it. On a rare occasion, I\u2019ll smell something that I genuinely enjoy, and it makes me sad. It could be all the way across town, it's not like some brownie in the kitchen, it's a bakery down on Walnut street. Also, all these different smells blend together too, which means I\u2019m smelling Cheetos, cigar smoke, and someone\u2019s leaky septic tank all at the same time. Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought. And flowers, I never thought they smelled that good to begin with.\n  \n\n  \nI have considered getting my sense of smell dealt with multiple times before. Just destroy the whole olfactory system. But I do like enjoying how things taste\u2026 I just didn\u2019t know. What I had was supposed to feel special, like some cool powers or something. I knew I should have been grateful, I just wasn\u2019t, until now.\n  \n\n  \nWhat changed? Well, food changed. Baking got realistic. You ask, what the hell does that have to do anything? Well, first, you ask too many questions, random reader, and second, I know, I wouldn\u2019t have thought it would mean much either, but it means everything. Even if baking is realistic, it must take an incredible amount of time and energy to make, right? Technology helped with that, also, there are way more bakers now. It\u2019s like a movement. Dancing, music, acting, writing, painting, sculpting, or whatever other artistic medium you can think of, they\u2019re all considered inferior to baking in this society.\n  \n\n  \nThis means that there are a ton of cake people all over the place. It\u2019s a political statement, I won\u2019t get into it, but essentially the way we treat the food industry is messed up, and the bakers are taking a stand. The government won\u2019t get off their high horse, however, and now we common folk suffer from this infestation.\n  \n\n  \nWell, how bad can it really be? I mean, free cake, what\u2019s wrong with that? Everything. I haven\u2019t eaten cake since this whole thing started, could you? It\u2019s the source of horror now, it's an infestation that is inescapable.\n  \n\n  \nThis is where I come in. You see, I can smell so well that I can smell cake. I know what is real or fake just by sniffing it. I was made for this infestation, I\u2019m the savior who is going to get us out of it. I even have my own following now, people grouped up with me and avoid what I tell them is cake. Sometimes I lie, I know it's wrong, but I finally have a useful power. \u201cOh.. sorry, that house is cake, we can\u2019t stay there for the night.\u201d That is, of course, where I will be staying for the night.\n  \n\n  \nIt\u2019s normalized now, I avoid what\u2019s cake and consider it just a daily annoyance. I watch as those who don\u2019t listen to me scream in horror as they embrace a cake person only to have them crumble. I watch them fall through cake floors or try to fire cake guns before getting subdued by an enemy with a real gun.\n  \n\n  \nI used to think truth was in decline, no one knew what sources to trust, but now, the world has descended so much further into mistrust. I am their only source of trust. I bring truth where everywhere else brings cake. I could get used to this savior thing, I\u2019ll just sit back in my \u2018cake\u2019 mansion, turn on the TV, and\u2026 \u201cBreaking news, the bakers have just invented a new odorless cake.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nFuck.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a unique premise and is full of potential.

In my hand, is a small ball of cake coloured with almost all the colours of the rainbow. \n\n*That cake used to be a chunk of my wife\u2019s arm.*  \n\nFor the past few months, random objects around the world were somehow transformed into a perfect cake replica. It started small, with things like cans of soda and flashlights. Then it grew bigger, replicating things like doors, streetlights, and TVs. At some point, the Eiffel Tower was transformed into cake. Anyone around the tower when it fell during that rainy day was killed, crushed under the huge blobs of cake that fell around them. People thought that was as bad as the \u201cCakedemic\u201d could get. Until today. Random people began disappearing, being replaced by cake in an instant. There is no cure, and there is no way to stop anyone from being caked. I never thought it would happen to anyone in my family though, but look at what just happened. \n\nI get up off the floor. I once read online that once one item is caked, it tends to spread to the surrounding environment, and other items nearby also get caked. I need to act quickly. \n\nI pick up a knife, and begin stabbing random things. Each time, the knife ends up with pieces of cake on the blade. The fridge, cake. The oven, cake.

It won\u2019t fool me.\n\nI stab him with the knife. He looks down at me, shocked. Oh no. He was not cake. I open my mouth, ready to say anything, but I freeze. Something\u2019s happening to him. \n\nThe blood dripping from his new stab wound isn\u2019t flowing anymore. Then it happens. The blood, previously a liquid, suddenly turns into red icing before my eyes, and I pull the knife out in shock. I look up at his face, and his expression remains frozen. He\u2019s just been caked. \n\nI clench the knife in horror, but something\u2019s wrong. I feel my hand go through the handle, as if it was just a pillow, but it isn\u2019t a pillow I\u2019m holding. It\u2019s cake. \n\nEverything around me begins falling apart. All of it is cake. The walls are cake. The ceiling is cake. The ceiling lights are cake.

Eventually, the cake fully covers me, and I begin suffocating. There\u2019s too much cake, and I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t eat my way out, and I can\u2019t move my arms.

Took him a moment to recall where he was. In bed, with his wife of seven years. Something had woken him up. Or something had woken up in him and forced him back to a state of consciousness. Either way, he was awake now and probably not going to get back to sleep. He got out of bed slowly to avoid waking his wife and went to make a cup of coffee. The time said 5:17am. As he was making his coffee, the dream he\u2019d been having came back to him. \u201cWeird dream,\u201d he thought to himself. How could the whole world turn to cake? Now he remembered what woke him up. His wife had turned to cake right before his eyes. It had felt so real. \u201cKnew i shouldn\u2019t have eaten that last edible,\u201d he muttered. As he turned to get his coffee from the coffeemaker, he caught a glimpse of his wife lying very still in bed. His heart started beating very fast and he broke out in sweat. A feeling of deja vu gripped him. The TV came on suddenly, lights flickered and there was a sudden gust of wind through windows that were closed a minute ago. Through all this, his wife still didn\u2019t move a muscle. Jason had a sudden idea. He picked up a small paperweight on the kitchen counter and threw it at his wife through the bedroom door to wake her up. He\u2019d tell her he slipped and it flew out of his hand. The paperweight flew across the room and Jason prepared to sooth his wife back to sleep the moment she woke. Except she wasn\u2019t waking. The paperweight didn\u2019t give the sound he was expecting from it slapping on flesh and he thought he\u2019d missed at first. Then he looked closer and he saw that the paperweight had landed on his wife. And sunk into her body. He could see into his wife\u2019s body and it looked like she was made of\u2026.cake? The cup of coffee slipped out of his hand and he started running towards where his wife lay on the bed. But he didn\u2019t get far. One moment, he was running and the next, he was slipping on a hardwood floor that suddenly turned soft and mushy. And then the floor gave way and he was falling.

We need to get out of here,\u201d his son, Micheal, said. That was a sentiment Jason wholly agreed with. He had no idea what the hell was going on but he wanted nothing to do with it. He made to get up but there was a weight on his legs. Jason looked down and he screamed! Lying across his legs was a body. Or what looked like a body, but made of cake.

Pushing themselves to make more and more realistic cakes, none of us simple minded folk could have seen what would come next. At some point during 2027-no one knows for sure-bakers began replacing items across the country. According to the now barely standing government, over the next 3 years these mass roll outs became increasingly common. During this time it wasn't uncommon to see news story's about hyper realistic cake being found where it shouldn't , lampposts, sidewalks, and even entire buildings were revealed to be made of cake. No one realized *people* would be in the next headlines. The day the story came out, the day it was revealed our president was made of cake, was the day all hell broke loose. The worlds finest scientists were unable to deduce much, it was found that the cake was somehow alive. It came to be understood that the cake consumed its victim before taking the victims form, this was how the mass roll outs happened. Baker's posed as anything from engineers to doctors and planted the cake anywhere they could along the way. The world became hell, sons and daughters killed their parents in fear they too would be infected. Riots filled the streets as the people found out truly how much was made of cake. The baker's took advantage of the chaos to introduce their own hyper realistic cake military, our own government crumpled under their force. Guns, trucks, and even battle ships were found to be cakeified. Top generals came out in support of our new cake rulers. Arguing that they couldn't possibly fight against a force who could so simply infiltrate their ranks. The few remaining survivors of humanity were forced to hide underground or conform to the cake society. After the first cake related headlines were shown to the public my wife and I decided to go deep underground. For some 8 years now we've been safe from the cake, and for that I'm grateful.

Drek had on a long black cape, and occasionally would pick at his long sharp teeth between explaining the week\u2019s upcoming activities, speaking loud enough to be heard over the drone of zombies moaning just beyond the walls. \n\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll be playing Bingo. And Wednesday is Board Game night, where we\u2019ll be playing games like the last copy of HEATED and a half-finished board of Monopoly,\u201d Drek reported, reading off a page. \u201cThursday will be an activity day, keeping us in reasonable shape in these trying times\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate activity day,\u201d Gerome mumbled next to Hunter. Hunter nodded to him, happy to see that others were tired of the reign of undead demons upon them. It gave him the valiance to speak up. \n\n\u201cWhat about Friday!? Is it feeding time?\u201d Hunter challenged, standing on top of his chair.\n\n\u201cOh, ummm,\u201d Drek looked ahead in confusion, not usually interrupted during evening announcements. He flipped ahead in the pages a bit. \u201cLooks like the watermelon is in good shape this season, so we\u2019ll be having some slices made available this week. There is enough for everyone, but do let us know ahead of time if you aren\u2019t a fan and we\u2019ll try to supply a replacement.\u201d\n\nThe audience murmured in appreciation. Watermelon was a rare treat in the Safe Zone. \n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Hunter looked around at the audience with open arms, imploring them to understand. \u201cWhen do the vampires intend to feed? When will we all be consumed?\u201d\n\nThe audience looked at him in a mix of confusion and horror. \n\n\u201cConsume us?\u201d Gerome asked.\n\n\u201cHow do you think the vampires live day to day? They have to drink blood pretty often!\u201d Hunter explained. \n\n\nThe audience turned to Drek, who sighed, upset that it seemed his groove of delivering the announcements was completely broken. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t typically go over our feeding schedules,\u201d Drek replied. \n\n\u201cStop avoiding the question!\u201d Hunter pointed. \u201cDo you eat humans or not?\u201d\n\nDrek scratched the back of his head, packing his pages of announcements behind his back.\n\n\u201cYeah, we eat humans\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!!\u201d Hunter bellowed, pointing even further, losing balance on his chair and wobbling. \n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t eat anyone in the Safe Zone,\u201d Drek continued, unperturbed. \n\nHunter deflated and fell entirely out of the chair. \n\n\u201cWhat? What do you eat?\u201d Hunter asked from the floor. \n\n\u201cThere are still plenty of humans living beyond the Safe Zone. We invite them here, but on the occasion they disagree, we wait until they are overrun by the zombies and take them before the zombies do,\u201d Drek answered patiently. \n\n\u201cSee!\u201d Hunter jumped up and quickly pointed before he lost his ground again. \n\n\u201cServes them right!\u201d someone called from the audience. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Hunter asked. \n\n\u201cThey shoulda joined the Safe Zone!\u201d \n\n\u201cWhatever it takes to feed our great administrators!\u201d Gerome called.\n\nHunter looked around the crowd, seeing how he lost the narrative so quickly. \n\n\u201cOh yeah? Well, what if that was true then why are we trapped in here?\u201d Hunter called. \u201cWhat if we tried to escape, what would you do to me then?\u201d\n\n\u201cEscape?\u201d Drek quickly lost his cool as he suppressed a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re free to leave. You can be out within the next ten minutes. Just make a request and you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake a request!\u201d Hunter pointed out, standing atop his chair once more. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just leave? Why do you need to know the whereabouts and timing of my exit?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to open the doors. We treat it like an airlock so no Zombies can get in. But I didn\u2019t realize you wanted to leave so badly, Hunter. We can organize this right away,\u201d Drek offered amiably. \n\nThe audience turned to Hunter, awaiting his response. His eyes widened as the silence of the audience was quickly filled with the symphony of groans of the decaying creatures, desperately clawing at the powerful walls keeping them out. \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Hunter swallowed hard, trying to regain ground once more. \u201cWhat about when you run out of people outside? How will you eat then?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe only have tentative plans right now, but we intend to have an opt-in program where people passing from terminal diseases and old age would donate their body in the moment before death,\u201d Drek replied.\n\nHunter finally grinned, the analogy to cattle fitting perfectly now, but before he could point that out to the crowd, they quickly replied. \n\n\u201cI will donate my life!\u201d one called. \n\n\u201cMy body for the cause!\u201d Gerome exploded, fist high in the sky. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t need the body anyway,\u201d another claimed. \n\nThe audience began thundering applause, already accepting the plans that had not been solidified by the administrators. The applause turned to a standing ovation, during which Hunter slinked away from the crowd before he was asked once again if he wanted to be among the world of the zombies, when the inside was a lot cushier than he gave it credit for.\n\n_____________________\n\n/r/Nazer_The_Lazer for more tales\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very strong. You immediately set the scene and introduce the conflict. I like the way you describe the amphitheater and the vampires. However, the dialogue in the story feels stilted and unnatural.

{"prompt": "I can still remember a time when things where normal. I try not to think about it too much. Reminice and pine over what once was. It will only make me miserable, I know.\nBut they are still there. Taunting me with dreams of my freedom and blissful ignorance before the outbreak. A time when we weren\u2019t confined to fenced off neighborhoods. When we didnt have to worry about our children getting too curious, wandering beyond this bubble of safety the vampires have corralled us into. \nLife goes on, and there is a false sense of freedom everyone has adopted. There are still schools, supermarkets, bowling alleys, arcades. But its not real, it\u2019s an illusion of freedom that we have come to know as normalcy.\n\nGod its bizzare saying it. Vampires. Things once of myth, and a source of fear to the skeptics and us children. Skeptics before, I guess I can\u2019t call them that now considering the circumstances. They had been right, of course. The things had craweld out of the shadows and into the light once the rotten bastards appeared, and they realized their food sorce was in danger. Posed themselves as saviors of humanity, offered help in the form of protection against the Zombies. At a price, of course. They have their pick. You see them in the streets, now emboldened by the new power they posess over us. Not all are bad, but like everything in life they have their rotten apples.\n\nIm well past my prime years now, they don\u2019t spare me a glance. I\u2019ve been alive to long in my opinion. Expired food, years have gone by since my sell by date. My children and grandchildren, I have to watch be occasionally called upon to be someones dinner. In the end, no one dies of course. But it\u2019s the conditioned fear from years of stories of monsters that never go away. Occasional stories of the rotten ones going to far. Theres always a sense of anxiety in the back of your head, no matter the reasurances the higher ups throw at us. Will they come back safe? The answer so far has been yes.\n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t complain. For the most part we are safe. The zombies are no more than mere flies to the vampires. Need only be swatted away with a hand, when a human might need backup to kill just one. Resilient things, I\u2019ll give them that much. But I can never seem to get rid of a lingering resentment for how things turned out, unjustified as it may be.\n\nWhile they are just stupid brutes, the zombies have for the most part learend to stay away from these havens set up around the world. Choose instead to go for the stragglers who refuse to be protected, and live in the deadzones as we call it. Original name, I know. Occasionally we get one bolder or maybe just hungrier then the rest wandering in, but it is swiftly handled. The vampires can smell the pungent smell of rotting flesh and death infultrate their sweet circle of perfumed bloodbags from miles away. We are safe. That\u2019s all that should matter.\nLooking out the window of my small house on a street of identical buildings, seeing children being able to run around the streets laughing and playing. Unaware truely of their situation, wonderfully innocent. This gives a feeling of peace. Fleeting happiness before thoughts begin to re-emerge from the back of my head and spiral. Soon, I will be gone from this world. I know it is my time soon, and I will no longer have to needlessly worry about things I should not logically be worried about. I will leave behind my family, and life will move on. Grandchildren will grow up and have children of their own. I wont know how the world will progress, what will happen years from now. \n\nSo I try to forget. I try to become one of those children kicking a ball in the street. To become innocent and ignorant again. Loose myself in their aimless chittering and laughter. Sink into their bright little smiles. And when it is night time, I lay awake knowing that childhood dreams turned nightmares of the day the world turns wait to torment me.\nThe day starts again, and all I can think is it is one day closer to the peace of an endless sleep. But for now, I will sit here and look out this little window in this little room, and I will wait.\n\nSorry I\u2019m a bit tired and havent written in years but it was fun, thanks for reading if you made it this far :)\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your opening paragraph is intriguing and effectively sets the stage for the story.

Like 30 Million Humans are living on it right now.\" Klint told to Hughes\n\n\"Yeah, but that was 2 years ago. Right now, almost a quarter of it exist as there was an outbreak. A zombie mutated thrice near the border and successfully destroyed its wall unleashing a massive amount of other double mutated zombies and normal zombies.

What really happened? Special forces have the power to one hit kill highly mutated zombies?\" Klint replied.\n\n\"Humor is that this triple mutated zombie is a Wood Elf Zombie. Very nimble and very fast. Like pure speed monstrosity and this zombie is a survivor from the first Earth out break. I don't how did it survived that long and how they didn't found it right away.\"  Hughes explained as he tuck himself to their transportation.\n\n\"Man, so it is still there?\" Klint asked with fear.\n\n\"Nay, they did managed to kill it but they paid a huge price.

Man, Those Ancient geezers are really up to something. I thought NRP - VI and VIII are already enough to supply us with a steady flow of blood and NRP - III will remain at is it?\" Klint replied to Hughes.\n\n\"Listen, Klint, 3/4 of NRP is a lost cause. What we will do is clean up that 3/4 and burn the bodies of other Grimms that died deep on the breached wall. Anytime soon, those dead bodies will turn into Zombies. Remember the Night Vampires and Dark Werewolves special forces? Higher ups predicted that in 2 or 3 months they will turn into Zombies. If we let that happens, NRP-III will be history. Give more time, NRP - XX isn't far away, it could be the next ruin. I just don't know why they don't just bring out the cleaners.\" Hughes told Klint.\n\n\"Cleaners are busy with other important thing.

Now, gents, what you see below is the ruined part of NRP - III. Can you see our reconnaissance team over there? We will move from there to the breached wall.

{"prompt": "\"Aaaaaaaaaaargh,\" \n\nscreamed Sharon, jumping backwards over the side of the bed. \n\n\"What the *hell* is going on?\"\n\n\"Calm down, Mummy! This is my new friend, Mr. Johnson,\" said Sara.\n\nThe tall and muscular figure who looked eerily similar to *The Rock* took a breath, and started talking. \n\n\"Sorry to intrude here, Mrs. Brennan.\" -- That voice, Sharon thought. It's really him! -- \"Believe me when I say, the surprise is mutual,\" said Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who was wearing pyjamas with blue elephants on top, yellow giraffes on the bottom.\n\nA few moments of contemplative silence passed. From behind the bed: \"That's really The Rock in my house right now?\"\n\n\"It is it is it is,\" cried Sara, gleefully. \"I wished for a pet rock from Santa in the mall, and I got the best one of them all!\"\n\nSharon raised her messy hair and bewildered face into view, for a sceptical look. \"Fucking hell,\" she gasped. Dwayne Fucking Johnson was standing *right there.*\n\n\"Hey, no swearing,\" Sara snapped.\n\n\"Look, it's Christmas day, and I'm really not meant to be here. So, Sara, it's been real meeting you, but I won't be able to stay for the tea party.\"\n\n\"But you said you would!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson said, not lying. \"Trust me, if I didn't have my own family to get back to, Fuzzy Bear and Malibu Barbie and I would be teapotting it up all afternoon with you.\"\n\nSharon looked on, vague, wondering if she was still drunk and stoned from the dinner party the night before. Had there been LSD going around? She was beginning to hope so.\n\nSara looked away, and started to cry. \"Now now, don't cry. Any girl able to summon *The Rock* out of thin air must be really, really strong,\" he said. \"Are you strong, Sara?\"\n\nShe wiped the tears from her eyes, and nodded her head. \"There it is. I think you might be the strongest girl in the whole neighbourhood!\"\n\n\"You really think so?\"\n\n\"No doubt about it.

Oh, yes. Of course. Mr. Johnson would know.\"\n\n\"Yay!\"\n\nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson gave them both his widest Hollywood smile, and Sharon found her confusion subsiding into instincts of a very different nature. My word he's handsome, she thought.\n\n\"Could I please use your phone? Had better explain to the wife where I am.\"\n\n\"Sure, down the hall on the wall next to the fridge.\"\n\n\"Great, thanks.\"\n\nSharon gathered herself and put her dressing gown on and picked Sara up. \"Well, missy. This'll be a Christmas we won't forget, that's for sure.\"\n\nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was still on the phone when they walked into the kitchen. He spoke quietly, but Sharon could tell something was wrong.\n\n\"Mummy, is Mr. Johnson okay?\"\n\n\"I don't know, honey. Let's give him some space to finish his call.\"\n\nDwayne 'The Rock' Johnson followed them to the loungeroom a few minutes later, as a different man than before. His towering frame slumped, crestfallen, eyes wet with tears, looking as if about to make some kind of plea.\n\n\"Well, ladies. Looks like the situation is stranger than I thought,\" he said.\n\n\"What's the matter, Mr. Johnson?\" Sara asked, with profound concern.\n\n\"Turns out I never left home, after all. My wife says I'm still sleeping in bed.\"\n\nIt was then, finally, that Sharon realised they were playing witness to the most insane Christmas miracle, surely, in history. Stranger than fiction, a singular cataclysm in humanity's understanding of science and physics and anything that Neil deGrasse Tyson from *Cosmos* had to say.\n\nSara, on the other hand, was thrilled.

I mean how did you get in and\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most direct answer is that your daughter summoned me,\u201d Dwayne replied.\n\nJannette could only manage a perplexed stare.\n\n\u201cThis will take some explanation if you wouldn\u2019t mind talking over breakfast. We can go out to a caf\u00e9 if you\u2019re not comfortable with me staying here.\u201d The Rock was characteristically calm and exuded trustworthiness.\n\nJannette took and a deep breath, sat up and said, \u201cno that\u2019s OK, let me whip up some eggs\u201d. \n\n\u201cKatie, help Mum set the table please.\u201d They all took their places.\n\n\u201cThank you Janette, these eggs look amazing ,\u201d Dwayne scooped up a generous mouthful.\n\n\u201cNow what I\u2019m about to talk you through is going to seem absurd. I will provide evidence but I\u2019m asking you to bear with and trust me for now. You have an important part to play too Katie so please pay attention,\u201d he addressed the child cheerfully.\n\n\u201cAnd before you ask, no this isn\u2019t a hidden camera show!\u201d he chuckled.\n\n\u201cAlright then, go ahead,\u201d Jannette sounded more than a little dubious.\n\n\u201cI need to tell you about The Rock Initiative. You see, my species first became aware of yours around 150 years ago. We\u2019re from the oort cloud \u2013 a huge mass of rocks orbiting the sun way further away from even the furthest planet, I know it used to Pluto for you guys.\u201d\n\nAlright, this is clearly some sort of research or market testing for a new script, Jannette thought. But still had no idea why The Rock would be visiting her in small-town America for such an exercise.\n\u201cOur life originated in an entirely different way to yours \u2013 that\u2019s not so important now. We gained intelligence and eventually started exploring our solar neighbourhood in much the same way you did. \n\n\u201cOur scientists first glimpsed the inner planets around 300 years ago. We noticed Earth not long after and it was clear that your planet harboured advanced life. The low gravity of our home worlds meant we were able to start voyages inwards with relative ease. There were some that wanted to make contact with you as soon as possible, however caution prevailed and we decided to carry out reconnaissance to learn more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuuum I\u2019m bored,\u201d Katie groaned. \u201cI know honey, but let\u2019s be patient and let Mr Johnson finish what he\u2019s saying.\u201d This wasn\u2019t quite blockbuster scifi so far, but she was engaged enough and wanted to hear more.\n\n\u201cThank you, we\u2019re getting to some exciting parts soon I promise,\u201d Dwayne settled back into his explanation.\n\n\u201cI was part of the first expedition to Earth. It so happens that we easily fit in with your surroundings, given we look just like rocks. We also live much longer than you, so hundred-year missions aren\u2019t a problem. We took up positions all around major cities in your year 1905. Observing and learning about humans was indescribable. You probably have no idea how amazing you all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazing!\u201d Katie happily agreed.\n\n\u201cBut then there were some events that deeply troubled us. I won\u2019t go into detail in front of Katie, but you know that the first half of last century was not a great time for humanity\u2026\u201d Dwayne\u2019s air of happiness receded and he paused reflectively. \n\n\u201cYes, I can only imagine what you must have thought if that was your first impression of us,\u201d Jannette replied. Am I really buying into this nonsense? She thought.\n\n\u201cWe sent reports back to our homeworlds. There was a strong push to abandon our mission completely and a feeling that we\u2019d best off if Humans never learned about us at all. While it was hard to disagree, I reasoned that there was no harm in continuing reconnaissance. At the very least, learning more could be handy if you were to ever discover us in the future. \n\n\u201cSo we stuck around through your 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s and kept sending back reports. Our view of your species started to shift. There was clearly a lot more to you than conflict and misery. But we remained shaken by what we had seen and making contact still seemed too risky.\n\n\u201cWe needed to learn more and set a better stage before the majority would be comfortable starting an interspecies exchange. \n\n\u201cOur scientists developed a kind of \u2018human suit\u2019 for us to really get to know you. They could never get the eyebrows quite right though \u2013 ours have a much higher range of movement. Luckily people seem to like that,\u201d Dwayne turned toward Katie and did his signature eyebrow raise. She giggled in delight.\n\n\u201cAlright Dwayne, this is a fun story that might even make for a decent movie. But we need to get ready for Christmas lunch with the rest of the family,\u201d Jannette started to clear away the table. \n\n\u201cFair enough and thank you for your time so far. You might want to skip soccer practice though, after you see this.\u201d Dwayne knelt down and placed a hand on Katie\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cThis is going to be scary, but I promise you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d \n\n\u201cOK, but it better be good if you want me to miss out on more present time,\u201d she replied.\n\nDwayne stood perfectly upright, his eyes glazed over and he touched the inside of his wrist. His torso began to pivot at the hip, while his legs remained in place. It stopped where his upper body was separated 90\u2019s degrees from his lower half. Katie screamed and ran behind her mother. \n\nDwayne\u2019s hand beckoned Jannette closer. She overcame repulsion and stepped forward. Rather than blood and guts, a small smooth stone sat in a cavity above Dwayne\u2019s pelvis. The stone started to vibrate and then flipped over in place a couple of times. With a wrist movement, his \u2018suit\u2019 started to shift back into regular human form. \n\nLife flickered back into Dwayne\u2019s eyes. \u201cPhew, it\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve been able to feel air on my skin\u2026 my real skin. Sorry to startle you, was that proof enough?\u201d \n\nJannette and Katie had moved several paces away.\n\n\u201cAlright alright we believe you. But then why on Earth are you here in my house and not meeting with world leaders?\u201d Jannette\u2019s head was swimming. Surely she would wake up any moment from this bizarre dream.\n\n\u201cAround 50s years ago my team started the pet rock craze. Most of us thought it would never take off \u2013 after all, why would you want to keep a rock for a pet? But if it worked, it would give us a way to get humans used to the idea of rocks as friends. To our surprise, households all across the world started adopting us. We didn\u2019t even mind the stick-on googly eyes. \n\n\u201cNow all we needed was a trusted and well know ambassador. That\u2019s where The Rock initiative started. I was given a new human suit with instructions and a plan to become a well trusted, or at least well-known celebrity. \n\n\u201cWe chose professional wrestling as a starting point \u2013 it was easy to design a tall suit with an impressive physique. While it seemed a bit obvious picking \u2018The Rock\u2019 for a wrestling name, I figured it would make for a fun reveal if the plan ever got to its final stages. My success in Hollywood was a massive bonus and helped get us to the point we\u2019re at today\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOK I guess that makes some kind of sense, in a nonsense way. But that doesn\u2019t explain where we fit into this.\u201d Jannette had relaxed a little and they took their spots back at the table.\n\nDwayne took a deep breath. \u201cWhat we really need is acceptance and understanding and we think Katie can help us with this.\u201d Katie was still cautiously clinging to Jannette. He again addressed her directly \u201cKatie, do you remember the message you sent to our website asking for a pet rock?\u201d \n\nKatie sheepishly looked up at her mother, as if asking for permission to respond. \u201cIt\u2019s OK baby girl, let him know what you sent.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, Mr Rock uhhmm.\u201d Katie stammered then gained more confidence as Dwayne smiled warmly at her. \u201cI wrote could I please please have a pet rock from Santa because rocks are great and they deserve our love just like doggies and kitties.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right Katie, that\u2019s what brought me here to ask: will you please help me explain to everyone that pet rocks \u2013 here on earth and out in space \u2013 need human love and understanding? It would really mean a lot to all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmmm OK Mr Rock,\u201d Katie looked up at Dwayne excitedly, \u201chow can I help?\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " First, I want to commend you for your strong opening. The Rock's sudden appearance in the protagonist's bedroom is definitely a hook that will keep readers engaged. I also like the way you introduced the concept of The Rock Initiative gradually, through Dwayne's explanation. This allows readers to slowly get invested in the story, rather than being overwhelmed with information all at once.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where your story could be improved. First, there is a lot of exposition in the beginning of the story. You could try to find a way to introduce the concept of The Rock Initiative more organically, perhaps through dialogue or action. Additionally, the dialogue in the story feels a bit stiff and unnatural. I would recommend reading your dialogue out loud to see if it sounds natural or if it needs to be rewritten.\n\nOverall, this is a strong start to a story. With a few revisions, it has the potential to be even better."}
{"prompt": "\"Don't sign the form\".\n\nThis did not surprise me. Since I've been 7 years old I've been receiving these messages.\n\n\"Don't chase Jimmy\" was the first. It was my birthday party, and I had received a bright red, toy car. I instantly fell in love with it's shiny coat and slick design. On the card read the usual message of my parents, wishing me happy birthday, and how much they loved me. But underneath, in red marker was, \"Don't chase Jimmy\". I was confused, but decided the toy car was more interesting than the strange message. Then my cousin Jimmy grabbed the car with glee in his eyes, spit on my shirt and ran. I almost ran after him, then jerked back, remembering the message. At the time I didn't know why I remembered it or even decided to heed its warning. At the time, I didn't realize how much I would learn to trust this voice, that the voice knew I would have no choice but to listen. I watched as Jimmy ran across the street in the middle of the road and be struck by a large truck, the toy car's pieces scattered, no more.\n\nThe messages followed, mysteriously. I never could catch who wrote them, but I soon learned this person, or being, knew my life intimately. They knew who my crushes were, my fears, desires, and even my thoughts. More importantly, it knew my future. \"Don't pursue Rebecca\". My crush at the time, but I listened. A week later I learned she had secretly been a lesbian. Some messages were commands. \"Talk to Mr. Latham\". He was my 7th grade biology teacher and after speaking with him, I found I developed a new found love for science. Perhaps it was his encouragement, or maybe even my enthusiasm born from reaching out, but I had become an A student in he class. In fact, I was the best student. I wasn't sure what the implications of this would be for the future, but I had learned many of the warnings and commands had far reaching consequences.\n\nThe future. It seemed almost predetermined for me. I felt lucky, incredibly charmed, that I had a secret informant. I've often tried to find ways to communicate with my benefactor. I would go out in the predawn hours, visit crossroads and graveyards, whispering, \"are you there? Who are you?\" I would plan for potential messages, spying on birthday cards, graded tests, letters. But the mysterious informant was always ten steps ahead of me. I never spoke of this to anyone, because I was afraid it might stop. I was afraid I would never have this help again.\n\nSo when I became 14, I was expectantly very excited. This was the time when one was given their powers by the Donarius Imperium. A vast, super-computer being created in the 70's. It had solved all of humanity's problems, such as disease, food waste, and war. Now, we have healthy conflict, nutritional exposure, and human cropping. All this has been possible due to the D.I.'s gifts - powers granted to humans when they turn 14. We are then drafted into our new roles and trained. I'm not sure why I never suspected the D.I. for sending me the messages. It probably had to do with the messages always being hand-written.\n\nBut after I had been given the edible tablet that would transform me, after I had been given the report, did I finally realize who had been writing me. I don't know why it took this long to realize, but it had been obvious from the start. The writing was unmistakable, but too strange to even comprehend. The writing was my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Don't sign the form\". Within the packet was the form asking if I would like to join the Peace Division. I had always wanted to be a part of the healthy conflict sector, to do away from those who would threaten our peaceful society. But the voice had spoken, I had spoken. And they have never once, in 7 years, been wrong. I took the form and then placed it into the shredder, waiting for the consequences to follow, as they always do, like dominoes.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story is well-plotted and engaging.

{"prompt": "[1/2]\n\nMy dad handled my **Instructions** in the same way he had always handled everything in his life. With absolutely zero nuance, and without asking a single follow-up question. \n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault. Dad had told me many times that the only way things didn\u2019t go absolutely downhill for him in life was when he followed the rules without any questions or overthinking. Which was probably a good thing in his case, otherwise he would\u2019ve ended all life on earth with his powers of molten nuclear destruction.\n \n\nBut my dad carried the manual with his **Instructions** always in his pocket. It\u2019s as thick as a phonebook, and he\u2019s been thumbing through that thing for as long as I could remember.  The pages had long since become worn and wrinkled from constant use. He knows all of it by heart - every letter, every line, every stipulation, safety measure and footnote. I\u2019m pretty sure he even has the table of contents memorized. \n\n\nWhich is why it was a little bit insulting, when he decided that the best way for me to memorize my own **Instructions** - a four word sentence, keep in mind - is for him to make me a bracelet with the phrase to wear on my wrist for as long as I live. \n\n\n\u201cJust humor him, darling.\u201d my other dad said to me, granting me a rare bowl of afternoon ice-cream along with a fond smile. The ceramic felt extra frosty from his icy touch, \u201cYou know how he worries.\u201d\n\n\nI did know. I did understand. I understood even better with the Owl sitting next to me. It was a manifestation of wisdom, I later found out, which I\u2019d created without even trying. I was more insightful while it existed, and it helped me understand the world with the acumen unbefitting a confused fourteen year old with knobby knees and awkward elbows. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why the Owl was the first thing I made. I was just angry and confused - already upset by the lack of instructions regarding my powers, and now also insulted by my brilliant father\u2019s lack of trust - and the Owl showed up, as though to help me understand. \n\nThat\u2019s why, even though I hated it with all my heart, I accepted the bracelet when dad emerged from his workshop. I put it on my wrist without complaining and stared miserably at the four words I was supposed to live by:\n\nDon\u2019t heed the Cat.\n\nI looked at the Owl next to me - owls were kind of like bird-cats. But it just blinked back at me with huge, round eyes.  \n\nAnd so began my life with my Animal Guides. \n\nThe Cat didn\u2019t show up for a long time. I waited for it every day, knowing that it would probably pop up the same way all the others did - when the situation demanded it, or I was in desperate need of its abilities. \n\nThat\u2019s how it went with the others, at least. I didn\u2019t have clear instructions on what to do, like most people, so everything played out through instinct and gut-feelings. \n\nI won my first school race with the Cheetah running by my side. I aced every test with the Owl on my shoulder. I stood up to my childhood bully with the Lion looming at my back. When I was with my friends, the goofy little Monkey would clamber things near me, making me feel giddy and making it easier for everyone to like me. And when I was feeling sad, the Dog would plant its scruffy head in my lap and look at me with big, soulful eyes, offering unconditional love and understanding. The Dog made me emotionally robust and helped me handle loneliness.  \n\nNobody could see my animals, so it was a little bit like cheating my way through life. My dads tried to discourage me from using them too much, but eventually they gave up. It\u2019s not like I had much control over when they\u2019d show up, and other kids my age liberally used their power wherever they could. \n\nIt all went along somehow, and became a normal part of my life, but I always kept wondering about the Cat. \n\nWhat was it for? When could I need it? What could it give me, and why was it forbidden? \n\nI got the answer on the day of my 21st birthday. \n\nIt probably wasn\u2019t an accident that my regular assessment was on that day. I showed up at my counselor\u2019s office bright and early and planted myself into the plastic chair by her desk. The Lion sprawled on the floor next to me, shrinking the space of the tiny office even more. \n\n\u201cGood morning, Liam.\u201d Mrs. Peterson was deeply focused on my file, like always, \u201cWhich one is joining us for this meeting?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe Lion.\u201d I replied. It had never occurred to me to even try to hide it, even though I hated the way she narrowed her eyes at me.  \n\n\u201cOh? Are you nervous?\u201d Mrs. Peterson was smug, like she cracked some kind of complicated code. \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d it came out defensive. I didn\u2019t want it to. But it was like that thing where you see a police car and try not to act suspicious, even though you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\n\u201cThen why the Lion?\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, why so nosy?\u201d is what went through my head, but what I blurted out was sadly the truth, \u201cI\u2019m actually going to ask someone out today. I\u2019ve liked them for a long time, so I guess I needed the courage.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh.\u201d Mrs. Peterson\u2019s entire face shriveled in disgust at something as plain as normal human interactions. She sniffed and click-clacked something down at her laptop, \u201cHas everything been normal since our last meeting?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo sign of the Cat?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, no Cat.\u201d \n\nClickity-clacking continued, less enthusiastic, for a minute. She finished and finally looked up at me and her face did a thing. \n\nHoly shit, what is that? \n\n\u201cNow, Liam,\u201d Mrs. Peterson said, as I came to a reeling realization that she was smiling. It was the most horrible leathery smile I\u2019ve ever seen, \u201cyou\u2019re at that age when you should start considering your future.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I said, staring at her teeth, \u201cI mean- yes. I don\u2019t know if college is for me, but-\u201d \n\n\u201cWe here at J\u00f6tunn Corp. feel that you would be an excellent addition to our executive offices.\u201d Mrs. Peterson\u2019s teeth said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got very unique, adaptable abilities that could be really polished into a shining diamond in our care.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey\u2026could?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course! We know you\u2019ve been using your Enhancers as crutches to get by in everyday life - and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d she said, a bit too quickly not to be rehearsed, \u201cBut imagine if you trained? Imagine if you unlocked things you couldn\u2019t even dream of? What if you could have a Bear give you incredible strength? Imagine if you had a Hawk that could make you fly!\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about flying, I\u2019m not good with heights.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point, Liam.\u201d her tone turned razor-sharp within an instant. She stabbed a blue flier in my direction. The surface was a deep indigo, with an emblem in the corner depicting three white birds taking flight, \u201cDon\u2019t let your gift waste away. You could do great things with us.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou should totally knock that ugly mug off her desk.\u201d said something small and black, perched on the arm of my chair. \n\nI looked down at the ugliest yellow mug I\u2019d ever seen in my life. My hand moved without my input and I swung hard, slapping the atrocity off the desk and onto the tiled floor.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few things you could work on to make it even better.

{"prompt": "When I was turning 14 my Father passed away. I've asked my Mother how he died so many times, but she only tells me he was a brave man. Trying the best I can on nights like these, dark, raining, flashes of lightning illuminating silhouettes, I still can't remember that night. \n\nEveryone knows the night before your 14th birthday you get your set of instructions to be able to use your powers. They are long dreary rules and habits that you must follow to have your powers. It also doesn't help they're written in lawyer speech, like terms and services, also commanding pages upon pages of these terms to follow. Lastly, they're like volunteer work. Always good natured and sometimes making you go out of your way to fulfill them.\n\nThis has coined their names as Saints, but largely they're made fun of because the powers they grant are seemingly useless. Such as, others can't speak when you are, while you're reading you won't walk into anything; Strange but absolute powers while you're doing a task.\n\nNow, while thunder peels back the silence of the night, I'm reminded of my theory that someone had to pay a cost to give a  message to certain people. If you didn't want to give powers to the wrong people, but also weren't allowed to only give it to select people, you'd make the rules ridiculous, long, and tedious, so only those who truly strove for them could use them.\n\nBut I've always found that short, punctual messages made more of an impact. Single words can hold such power, depending on the context. Kill, Run, Catch Them, Survive. They hold so much more meaning when they're not covered in so many words.\n\nNow, I'm 30, balding, and work as a night guard at a children's home.

{"prompt": "It all started soon after when the disasters hit. They were never the same, with nothing similar except for the human death toll, but they came on a monthly schedule like clockwork. Not on the same day, but once a month, no more, no less, and with casualties in the tens of millions. It was never in doubt which was the *disaster*, even when some pretty terrible stuff happened the same month. Despite all our fecundity, the human population went from growing to shrinking. A year after a paper went out from an unknown account, to, quote, \"give us a fighting chance\". It gave detailed instructions for producing a serum, that if taken before puberty would provide superpowers to the children. Considering one of the disasters was an as of yet incurable epidemic, the medical regulations have been relaxed, but some guy who had access to the necessary equipment, a few kids, and a lax stance on ethics still beat them to the first human trial. The Willisberg case became world famous, from the court proceedings to their daughter Marie, with a superpowered immune system whose blood donations helped develop the first cure to the epidemic. While individual *gifts*, as many came to call them, were amenable to scientific analysis (and, in fact, brought many breakthroughts of their own), the serum itself was an absolute mystery. We knew some things about it, but those things raised more questions than answers. \n\n* The procedure to create it involved inserting a particular genetic sequence into a bacterium and collecting its excretions. The sequence was about ~20k base pairs in length and contained 13 genes coding for proteins never seen before. \n* The genetically modified bacteria were self-rewriting, with the inserted gene expanding itself like a compressed file. A line of bacteria somehow synchronized on and produced a serum of plasmids containing another DNA chain, this one over a million base pairs in length. This sequence was different for each line, and only a few variants (e.g. the super-strength one) have been even partially decoded. \n* When injected into a child's body, the serum would produce mutations and severe systemic inflammation. Within a month, around 95% would recover and have no ill effects, though tests revealed modified DNA and visible changes to the spinal cord, brain stem, pituitary gland, corpus callosum, frontal lobe and amygdala. \n* Around the start of puberty, the child would experience symptoms resembling a focal or absence seizure, and have a profound psychological experience. That would be their brain linking to the powers that have been developing in them. \n\nThat's usually when they were taken away for questioning and assigned a job track. That much I knew from research on the Internet, when it works. The acid rain took out our city's cable a month ago and I had to go to libraries ever since. I took every opportunity to learn as much as possible as my day was approaching. I was surprised by how many didn't care. I mean, they call me gifted and maybe I'm smarter than most 14-year-olds, but still, even if I couldn't understand everything I'd try and know as much as possible about what was happening in *my* body! If there's anything worth learning about, it's your body! And if superpowers didn't exist we would fantasize about them all the time I bet, but all the kids are acting like something being real takes the fun out of it. The \"awakening\" scared me most of all, for some reason. The last few years, I was paranoid about everything that could go wrong, and I suppose with horrible things happening every month it's unavoidable, but I could visualize the scenario, all my senses overloaded, my muscles shaking as hard as they can as my brain cells fry one by one like a computer in a microwave. \n\nIt happened when I was sitting in class. First my head started to hurt and I saw white in my peripheral vision, like the opposite of a brownout, and something told me to look ahead or I would be blinded by looking to the sides. And I tried to keep my eyes forward as the brightness focused into hundred, thousands of images and put my head down on the book so I wouldn't fall and hit it and closed my eyes and\n\nfelt like a blind person opening ten thousand eyes for the first time\n\nme in a lab, strapped to a bed, a screen flashing questions and me saying will you let me go if I answer this one and the doctor reaches towards the lever and before I can scream NO there is\n\n**PAIN**\n\nand me in a beautiful meeting room and signing an order to gas the uprising before they become loud enough to spark a civil war and\n\n**GUILT**\n\nand me being led to a bunker and knowing that when the door is sealed the longest timeline we have ahead of us is six months and \n\n**REGRET**\n\nand me being led to the exam room while the woman behind me in doctor's clothes motioned me in and closed the door and forced down her guilt but I didn't care I just wanted it to be over and\n\n**NOTHINGNESS**\n\nI closed my thousands of eyes out of pain, I couldn't bear to look at what was in front of me, that was what I told myself and the images faded, all except for a few. I saw a plan laid out before me, except it was more of an anti-plan. I didn't come up with it by seeking the future I wanted. I came up with it by flinching in pain from the futures that were too terrible for me to watch. \"Don't let *them* know.\" I knew who *they* were. I saw *their* first meeting, before the first Disaster. \n\n(to be continued, maybe)\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are areas that need improvement. One issue is that your story is choppy and difficult to follow in places. For example, the sentence \"While individual *gifts*, as many came to call them, were amenable to scientific analysis (and, in fact, brought many breakthroughts of their own), the serum itself was an absolute mystery.\" is confusing and could be rewritten more clearly.

Additionally, in the third paragraph, you might want to clarify what the protagonist is wondering about.\n\nIn general, I think your story has potential, but it might benefit from a bit more development in terms of plot and character.

{"prompt": "To get the description of your magic power you'll have to dip one piece of paper in the water from the magic fountain. Seemed pretty simple but whenever I tried it my paper didn't say anything until I picked it up. I held it against the sun like it's usually done and with my heart racing I opened my eyes ready to see the very long yet amazing description, but when I looked there were only four big words written on the paper. \"Don't make eye contact.\"\nMy dad, mom and sister were waiting by the car, they said they wanted me to have this moment and tell them all about it when I'm ready. What do I tell them now? My sister said her description was so lengthy she had to use two sheets of paper and it could have basically been summarized by saying \"you can make things levitate.\" The average human being was getting about one to two page description of their super power so what is with this? Maybe my family was playing a prank on me. Yep that must have been it. I mean I saw the ritual happen a thousand times and everyone had at least half a page of description of their powers. \"Don't make eye contact\" hah that's so dumb I almost fell for it too.\n\"Are you done? Mom and dad are in a hurry. We can read everything in the car.\"\n\"You know you almost got me with this one.\" I turned to face my sister and as soon as I made eye contact with her she burst into flames like a tank of gas. I watched it all happen and I couldn't do anything but listen to her screaming and begging for help. I dropped to my knees crying. The only thought in my mind was what have I done. I watched my sister take a few more steps and drop lifeless on the floor. My parents both freaked out, came to her rescue but I knew my sister was dead and it was all my fault. My dad was yelling at me asking what happened but I couldn't answer, the sheet of paper that forever changed my life was in front of me with the same four words written on it.\nMy mom called out to me but I told them to stay away. I covered my eyes in fear. I knew if I looked them in the eyes they would end up just like my sister. My mom tried to grab my hand but I told her to get away. I couldn't hold my tears any longer. What have I done? My mother picked up the paper and read the four words horrified. She called out to my dad who was still checking on my sister and when she showed him the paper he read it out loud. \"Don't make eye contact.\"\nHearing them again made me lose my mind. Why? What kind of power is this? Or should I say curse. What have I done to deserve this? Why is this happening to me?\nMy dad said my name and unconsciously I looked up at him. The last word he said was \"you\". He burst into flames just like my sister. My mother, scared to death, was trying to put him out when she turned and looked me right in the eyes. It wasn't longer before she too was engulfed by the flames of death. I watch as they both die burned alive right before my eyes. Their screams will forever be a memory that will plague my mind till death.

{"prompt": "\u201cIt\u2019s inefficient and slow.\u201d The insufferable little man complained for the third time in 2 standard intervals. \n\n\u201cThe Lyrnaure way represents true travel beyond light speed.\u201d Uhigiria made the message flash on the humans small display screen tied to the small man\u2019s wrist.

That was the downside of the display screens, humans tended to look at them while talking instead of who they were actually talking to. Uhigiria reached out with a body hand and grabbed the human by its head tilting its face up to look at him.\n\n\u201cSuggestions are asked of you, not meaningless complaints.\u201d The words appeared on the screen in the corner of the human\u2019s eye as he looked up at the pale 4 eyed face of his supervisor. \n\n\u201cAlright, we should drift between the Lyrnaure way gates.\u201d The human said firmly.\n\n\u201cHow would turning our engines off increase efficiency?\u201d Uhigiria asked, as mad as it sounded there might be a chance to save fuel rattling around in this human\u2019s brain.\n\n\u201cNo not like that.\u201d The human explained brushing Uhigiria\u2019s hand aside and hopping up on a stool next to the display screen. \u201cAlright so the gate travel is awesome, post light speed and all that, but its only straight lines, so you have all these turns and intersections where gates going in different directions meet up. We always spend like half a week at those damn things slowing down to just a few hundred kilometres per second, re aligning with the next gate and then going through. We could have been halfway to our destination in that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe time spent between gates can indeed be long.\u201d Uhigiria conceded as he watched the human drawing lines and shapes he presumed was meant to represent one such intersection of Lyrnaure ways. \u201cIt is required for safe exit and re-entry of the Lyrnaure ways.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not.\u201d The human claimed, once again speaking to his wrist screen. \u201cI\u2019ve done the math, if we angle the ship while in the Lyrnaure way and we turn off the inertia dampeners for just a fraction of a second at around 0,24 seconds before we hit the exit then we could carry out a good 3% of the speed from the Lyrnaure way. That means we could be going like 100,000 kilometres per second as we exit. Now if we\u2019ve angle ourselves right we can blast afterburners like there\u2019s no tomorrow and ride that speedboost all the way to the next gate and hit it at the perfect angle to sail straight through and complete the crossing in minutes rather days.\u201d\n\nUhigiria watched the little man ramble excited about his plan. It had been wrong to hope for a way to save fuel, humans had never been able to differentiate efficient and fast. \u201cThe idea is ludicrous. The strain on the ship for moving at those speeds outside the Lyrnaure ways would be-\u201c\n\n\u201cWell within safety limits, I\u2019ve already done the math.\u201d The man said and slapping what looked suspiciously like a drawn on napkin onto the screen, Uhigiria decided not to find out what made it stick. He leaned in and studied the numbers.\n\n\u201cHave you run them by the computer?\u201d He asked as he looked at the meaningless scribbles, he had never been gifted in numbers, but he wasn\u2019t about to let a human know that.\n\n\u201cYeah, it all checks out within safety limits.\u201d He smiled as he hopped down from his stool with a bump that hid a muttered \u201cTheoretically.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright human, I suppose it is worthy of an attempt.\u201d Uhigiria admitted, spending less time between Lyrnaure ways would greatly enhance their ability to react to changes. \u201cBut what about the risk of other ships being at the intersections?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I\u2019ve got a solution for that, we can set up a stationary radiation emitter at each one that emits electromagnetic waves through the Lyrnaure ways to let people know it\u2019s their turn to go. It would travel at the speed of light, hit the gate to get ramped up in speed and reach the other end in time to tell whoever wants to enter if the coast is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadiation emitters can be harmful. We will have to choose the frequency carefully.\u201d Uhigiria noted carefully.\n\n\u201cI suggest we pick Red light and Green light.\u201d The human said proudly and shrugged when asked to elaborate on why. \u201cJust makes it feel like home.\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening sentence is good, it immediately establishes the tone and voice of the story.

When the sky deepened to cobalt, she slipped into her robe and began her silent prayers to the ancient creatures. By the time she finished, the stars were lulled and the sky was a deep, sleepy black.\n\nAs stealthily as possible, Rial made her way through the shadows of the commune and snuck out onto the streets.\n\nShe closed her eyes here, sheltered in the doorway, and listened for the hiss of the patrol drone.

No enjoyment in her life except for watching the sky deepen and lighten, deepen and lighten, through her tiny window.\n\nShe might not have hung on long enough to even join the dead church if it wasn't for the threat: if you take your life, the government takes ten others in your name.

The yellow-orange of wax candles burning.\n\nShe turned the corner and opened the hatch to the church, singing loudly. \"Oh great humanity...\"\n\nThe hatch creaked open.\n\nShe stopped very suddenly, too stunned to turn and run. \"But...\"\n\nA rough hand snatched her arm and drew it behind her back.\n\n\"Got another here,\" said the man who'd grabbed her.\n\nThe singing... it'd been a trap. A recording of the usual choir, played to lure in other members. To lure her in.\n\nShe knew that had to be the case because the real choir, along with the priest and most of the congregation lay in bloody heaps on the stone altar and shallow nave. The priest's grey beard was dyed bright red. A hole ran through his forehead.\n\nThe air tasted of iron. Of death. It settled over Rial's skin and tongue.\n\nAnother man approached her, a man with wide lips twisted into a perverse grin. \"What a shame she was late to the party. She's missed all the fun.\" He paused then added, \"Well, maybe not all of it.\"\n\nSome of Rial's shock fell away, only to be replaced by anger. By hatred. She stomped her boot as hard as possible on the guard's foot. He let out a muffled scream and released her arm.\n\nBefore either man could react, she was back out of the hatch. She slammed it shut and turned the lock. It wouldn't buy her long, but maybe long enough. She darted through the tunnels, left, left, right... Trying desperately to remember the route the priest took them on that one day every year.\n\nWhere was it? It was almost impossible to find anything in this darkness. She was running blind, her hands pawing at walls to find the curves.\n\nShe could hear footsteps somewhere behind her. They were already through.\n\nGaining.\n\nThere it was! The ladder. She shimmied down into the next labyrinth of tunnels. Left, left, right, same as before. The darkness here was deafening. Mind consuming. She found the next ladder though, and now nothing seemed to be following her.\n\nShe could feel the hot tears running down her cheeks. She wiped them away and told herself to keep them for later. Right now, she had work to do.\n\nThe secret passage swung open when she pulled at the right brick. Rial stepped through into the sacred room.\n\nThis room was well lit, unlike the rest of the underground. Smooth white metal walls were covered in consoles and buttons. And in the centre of the small room lay the container.\n\nShe leaned over the glass and, beyond her own tearful reflection, she could see the sleeping human within. The last human.\n\n\"Please,\" she said. \"Please wake up. I need your help.\"\n\nRial tried to pry open the glass. The priest had said never to touch it. That if they broke it, the human would die. Instead, they must wait until the human had slept enough. Only then would its wrath be unleashed.\n\n\"Please!\" She hammered on the glass with her fists. \"Please.\"\n\nFootsteps again. How had they tracked her already? Shit, they must have had thermal imagining glass. They were following her footsteps. They'd see her prints walk into a brick wall, and then... Shit, shit shit! She'd led them right to the human. She was going to die and she'd let everyone down. The last human would die with her. Because of her.\n\nPanting, she stepped away from the container and leaned against a wall.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. To the human. To all her friends. To herself. \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nShe slouched down against the wall.\n\nA strange voice said, \"Activated.\"\n\n\"Huh? Did... Did someone say something?\" No reply. She checked the container: still closed. What had she heard? Anything at all?\n\nThe wall of the secret passage exploded inwards, throwing Rial to the floor.\n\nThree men stepped through the wreckage, guns smoking. And there, behind them, was the grinning man. Although he was no longer grinning.\n\nHe looked around, frowning. Then at Rial, he said, \"Kill her.\"\n\nThey raised their weapons. Aimed.\n\nFour quick bursts came from somewhere in the ceiling. Four blinding lights.\n\n\"Threat eliminated,\" said the strange voice.\n\nThe men were gone. Completely and utterly gone.\n\nRial got back to her feet just in time to hear the hiss of hydraulics. To see the curls of purple smoke escape from the rising glass of the container.\n\nThe human was waking.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " First, I will commend you on your use of description and setting. The story is set in a dystopian future, and you do a good job of making the world feel real and lived-in. I especially like the detail about the \"hail-rock\" skylight.\n\nThat said, there are a few things you could do to improve your style. One is to vary your sentence length a bit more. Right now, most of your sentences are relatively short, which can make the writing feel choppy. Try adding in a few longer, more complex sentences to break things up.\n\nAnother thing you might want to work on is your dialogue. Right now, it feels a bit stiff and formal. This could be a deliberate choice on your part, to reflect the stiffness of the characters' speech, but if not, you might want to try to make it sound a bit more natural.\n\nOverall, you have a strong story here. With a few tweaks to your style, it will be even stronger."}
{"prompt": "\"BEHOLD!\" I exclaimed, raising all of my arms to the sky. \"The eldritch God has returned!\"\n\nThe congregation behind me raised their arms in imitation of mine, most trembling with religious frenzy. These people had heard stories of the elder gods since they were larvae, hummed through their hives by the brood mothers. To see one in the flesh had been unthinkable mere days before. Few had believed me when I revealed my vision of their return. \n\n\"The God Jimbob has returned to our mortal plane of existence! His light shines upon us all!\" My own limbs were trembling now, partially from this holy experience, but mostly from the exertion of holding up my staff over my head for so long. I decided that the Eldrich God Jimbob may be ok with a kneeling supplication as well, and dropped to my knees. The followers of Jimbob behind me copied this stance as well, almost in unison. \n\nAs I was trying to think of what to say next, I heard a voice shout from behind me. It was faint, just barely audible from both distance and the speaker's old age. \n\n\"Stop this at once, youngling!\" The voice said. I turned towards the interloper and saw an old brood mother, walking towards me slowly on her old exoskeleton. \"We need to seek refuge, not worship!\"\n\nI scoffed at her. This was not my brood mother, so I owed her no respect or allegiance. She was probably just envious that I now had more influence in the hive than she did. \n\n\"Why would we run from the embrace of our creator?\" I asked, making sure to speak loud enough for my flock to hear. \"This is the Elder God Jimbob! He who provided us grains and seeds to feast upon, he who made our world with his own hands, he who was fortold to drive away the cold and snow, and restore the fields to their former glory!\"\n\nThe brood mother trembled, in either frustration or weakness. One of the members of my flock ran to her aid, grabbing her thorax to help her remain upright. She shrugged him off with a valiant effort. \"This Jimbob was prophesied to return, but as a destroyer! Not a creator!\"\n\nI scoffed again. \"Who was the blasphemer that told you this lie? We shall sacrifice them to the creator!\"\n\n\"It was my own brood mother\" she said. \"She passed down the stories from before the snow and the cold, before the fields turned brown and the light disappeared. It was Jimbob who closed us in this infernal place to begin with!\" \n\nI could tolerate this sacrilege no more. \"Blasphemer!\" I cried, raising my staff at her. \"Kill the blasphemer! Silence her unholy screeches!\" \n\nThe congregation instantly turned into a riot. The dismemberment would not be pleasant to look upon, and I did not want to sully this encounter with God. I turned and strode back to the front of the gathering, to the place closest to the gargantuan form of Jimbob. \"Heed not the unbeliever, oh mighty Jimbob!\" I cried, supplicating myself once more before him. I could only hope he could hear my pleas in time. \n\nSuddenly, I was flooded with a brilliant light, and saw a divine hand reaching towards me.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\"Aw hell, skeeter\" I said, backing out of the old shed. \"Looks like bugs dun' got in there over winter.\"\n\n\"Sheeit, Jimbob\" my cousin replied. \"Just chuck a bug bomb in there, we'll come back f'rit in the mornin.\"\n\n\"Well ain't that an idea, Skeeter. How are we gonna go fish if we cain't get our fishin' stuff?\"\n\nSkeeter hocked a large brown stream of chewing tobacco spit on the ground. \"Well, maybe we just need to find som'n else to do today. Just kill those critters and let's git goin.\"\n\nI opened the shed door once more. The bug bombs we had got from Tractor Supply last spring were still there on the shelf just inside. I reached to grab it, sweeping a lone bug off the top of the can before activating the spray. \n\n\"we'll come on back tomorrow.

{"prompt": "\"Will you be attending the ceremony that the Whimmies are holding in our honor your highness? asked the high priestess.  It would mean a whole lot to them if we show up even if just for a brief moment. It is thanks to them that your highness is able to maintain the battery of the luxurious aquarium active. Thus keeping your greatness' vast society of fish alive and healthy.\"\n\n\"Put it on my to do list Thena, commanded the god. Why do the Whimmies persist on me attending  every single one of their pointless ceremonies. Are they not aware that I have a kingdom to run. One day I am going to invent a hologram machine just so I can appease my fanatics while enjoying the benefits from my throne.\"\n\nThe kings sat apathetically in his chair. A look of concentration and carelessness rested on his face. The high priestess approached the God with the upmost gracefulness.\n\n\"That is great news your highness! exclaimed the priestess. I will reply to the mayor Of Whim at once. I will let them know of all the requirements that must be met to ensure your presence at the event. Would you like to requests any special items in the list of accommodations that will be sent to the Whimmies. I understand one of the guards almost lost their heads because there were no blue Gatorades at the last ceremony you attended.\n\nThe god let out a hearty laugh and almost tipped his entire throne over.\n\n\"I remember the incident differently but alas make sure that my headquarters are filled with the raspberry flavored beverage. That is the only flavored suited for a king.\"\n\n\"Very well your highness, replied the priestess. \n\nThe high priestess exited the god's lair and the god remained seating with only his thoughts to accompany his mightiness.\n\nI wonder how the Whimmies would react if they found out that  the meaning their entire existence was to keep the batteries running inside my aquariums motor. Would they all go mad with the possible restlessness produced by their reality? Or would they thrive and come together as a species unified by the same struggle? \n\nThe god tried his best to enjoy his throne. He was contemplating going out and exploring his kingdom when he heard a loud knock on the door.\n\n\"Brother! exclaimed a loud and thunderous voice. Open the door or by the heavens I will strike the barrier down.\" \n\nThe god stood up from his throne and apathetically made his way to test the hinges of the door. The god was pleased to see that the hinges remained unscathed. The door swung open nearly swiping the apathetic god. The door summoned an identical creature who few would question as the heir to the throne.\n\n\"Listen Tony, pleaded the heavily bearded man. You must not attend the ceremony that the those conniving whimmies have set up in your name. I heard from a trusted source that those ungrateful whimmies plan to assassinate you upon delivering your speech. Brother i am not ready to fill the shoes of such a virtuous man as yourself. Please Brother i beg you to reconsider your trip to Whim. Or at the very least obliterate their entire society with a simple discarding of their source.\"\n\nThe god remained apathetic. He stared at the despair leaking from his brother's presence. \n\n\"I am offended Toluc, expressed the ambient being. Not by the Whimmies' futile attempt at my life but by how much faith you have in my ability to foresee future miss-happenings. I have survived all the shots they have fired at my life and I plan to continue living all the way past the extinguishing of Zorodo.\"\n\n\"Brother I admire your faith in your ability to fool the Whimmies, admitted the younger sibling. But brother I plead that you don't  take the Whimmies lightly. a paid informant has notified me that they have reached the next level in their enlightenment and it will not be very long until they are able to transverse through dimensions like you and I. Then there will be very little that separates us from them.\n\n\"I appreciate your worry  Toluc but the day where I hide from my would be opponents has yet to arrive, announced the divine figure. And I intend to remain grounded. If it would ease your mind I can share some of the things I have invented over the years to ensure my safety in an attempt at my life.\n\nThe god opened up his wardrobe and pressed a button that revealed a hidden compartment built within its borders. Inside the compartment there were many gadgets and different kinds of suits. \n\nThese are the Suits that our ancestors have left for us to build upon if need be Toluc. I could be punished with exile for letting anyone know that the suits are not mere myth.\n\nThe slightly shorter but just as commendable sibling stared in awe as he tried to enter the wardrobe's hidden compartments.\n\nI beg your pardon Brother but these chambers are only accessible to me, explained the heavenly figure. I have made sure that if anybody with a different retina than the one i possess dared to enter the chamber of secrets their entire DNA Structure would be instantly disconfigured. Thus turning the unlucky being in a gelatinous puddle of goo.\n\nThe apathetic god entered the chamber and proceeded only when all the safety procedures were met. He approached a sleek purple and gold suit. He Took his time admiring its immaculate figure. He removed the suit from behind the glass and commenced to enter its fitting. After the suit was evenly distributed throughout the god's perfectly chiseled body the divine figure commenced to mess with the suit's settings. He pushed a button and a identical twin spawned out of thin air wearing the same exact thing as the ruler.\n\n\"I hope your pay suffices your informant's lust for duty, declared the master. Because if my clone gets assassinated that would mean he was doing his job and I would have to save him from his race's extinction.\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed is that you have a lot of dialogue in your story.

What information are we getting from this exchange that we couldn't get in a different way?\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that you have a lot of telling instead of showing. For example, you tell us that the king is apathetic, but we don't really see that in his actions or dialogue. Show us why he is apathetic instead of just telling us.\n\nFinally, you have a lot of exposition in your story. While it is important to provide some background information, you want to make sure that it is essential to the story and that it is not just taking up space.

He saw a shirt floating in the air, a needle going through it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can show yourself to me. I\u2019m a friend.\u201d\n\nNothing happened. The shirt shuffled out of sight, and Jon seemed to be alone in the room, though he knew he was not alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not like him. I\u2019m not like my father. I want to set you free.\u201d Jon felt his face grow taut with feeling.\n\nSuddenly, a little ghost revealed herself. She was a grey tinted mist with straw-colored hair and no eyes. The mother immediately shushed her and the ghost girl disappeared.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Jon got on his knees. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nHe stayed like that for several minutes with nothing happening. Finally, the father appeared, tall and gaunt grey mist. \u201cWhat dooo you waaaant.\u201d The voice was an echo.\n\n\u201cI want to set you free. From the sewing business.\u201d\n\nThe father stared at him. \u201cThe person who owns this house gives us an impossible amount of garments, makes us work all hours of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it will never stop.\u201d Jon said. \u201cUnless my father is scared. Unless\u2026you tried to\u2026you know\u2026take him out. Not like seriously, but just enough to scare him.\u201d\n\nThe father made a fist. \u201cDo not talk of violence around my daughter.\u201d\n\nJon sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But how will you be free?\u201d\n\nThe ghost mother appeared. She looked more hollow than the rest of them. \u201cWe won\u2019t. This is our cross to bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are other abandoned houses. A big one on Main Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since we left.\u201d The father pointed his face at Jon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Jon said.\n\nThey opened the door and walked together. The ghosts gasped when they saw a McDonalds or a gas station or a streetlight or the stars. They were not used to a Mississippi that looked like this.\n\n\u201cThis is a world I do not recognize.\u201d said the mother.\n\nFinally, they found the old abandoned house. It was even older than the haunted house Dicks Magee had bought. Jon heard a choked sob.\n\n\u201cThis is my grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d The ghost mother said. \n\nBefore Jon could look up, the ghost family was invisible again. Gone. He was alone in the star-filled night, swearing he heard a \u2018thank you\u2019 on the wind\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very strong. You immediately set the scene and introduce the characters. I especially like the detail about the \"stained glass window beside them, with yellowed nails slowly scraping up against it.\" This gives the reader a sense of the eerie atmosphere in the house.\n\nHowever, the middle of the story drags a bit. You include a lot of exposition about Dicks Magee's business venture, which is not particularly interesting or necessary to the story. I would suggest cutting down on this and getting to the conflict between Jon and Dicks Magee more quickly.\n\nThe end of the story is also very strong. I like the idea of the ghosts being set free and finding their way back to their old home. This is a heartwarming and satisfying ending."}

Not even his own. \n\n\u201cAll the power in the world is available to you, slapping against your legs-\u201c\n\n\u201cThanks, pal.\u201d He said playfully.\n\nThe voice growled and grew hot in his head- of annoyance and embarrassment. \n\n\u201cI am talking about *me*. Through *me* you could have all the power in the world, yet you leave me tied against your waist.\u201d It snarled, trying to shave away the moral walls in the hero\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think swords could have penises.\u201d He said aloud as he passed a trio maidens shopping, who looked at him befuddled. The hero smiled politely and waved.\n\nNow the voice was creating a storm within his brain, bringing on a searing headache. The hero merely winced but kept walking through the marketplace, focusing on his hunger and for a bite to eat.\n\n\u201cDO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE INSULTING?!\u201d The sword thundered.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t, and I wouldn\u2019t care to know. Now hush before I bury you in a forgotten well full of dirt.\u201d He said with a strained expression.\n\nThe storm fell away and the sword conceded, giving the hero a moment to look at his surroundings. This village in particular was quiet. In the hustle and bustle under the setting sun, this was probably his best chance to sneak something to eat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t consider himself a thief. Food was created from the planet, so why should he pay for it? Because someone else claimed it?\n\nMostly because he was broke. Always broke. But only because money was a human concept and one he didn\u2019t agree with.\n\n\u201cWhy have you kept me, then?\u201d The sword asked.\n\n\u201cGotta have a sword.

His cargo had been struck with arrows, no doubt from wood bandits. And falling out the end of his carriage was an abundance of fruit. Children were grabbing them as they fell, laughing happily. \n\nHe quickly and slyly kicked a few apples into the air and caught them in his gi shirt pocket.

Nobody was really free anymore, and it did bother him that he abandoned so many. But would they do anything for him? \n\nThen he thought about what the sword meant about *ultimate power.* \n\n\u201c\u2026so what is the ultimate power?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cLet me taste blood and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026What if it\u2019s my own blood?\u201d He asked.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very strong.

He was replaced quickly.\n\n\"Well now you're dead, so shut the fuck up,\" the wandering warrior, covered in scars and aged far too quickly for his time, spat without sympathy as he took his blade from the sheath of greyed flesh. He smirked in expected displeasure to find his old steel armament melting in the viscous bile that flowed through my host's veins. \"Shit.\"\n\nWithout thought or care, he took me from the skeletal hand of the tyrant-king, that should have been his downfall. SHOULD HAVE BEEN.\n\n\"*Thank you for freeing me, mighty hero!*\" I spoke into his heart, in a flash of light I turned from a curved and jagged wretch of blackened metal to an exact image of his ideal blade: A simple, straightened sword of undecor'd steel, scratched yet sturdy like his dented armour. \"*Rejoice, for I am a blessed relic!

The king, he was cruel, but his father, he was a man of great renown, of nobility and generosity.

And so I have inhabited that stretch of steel. I have revenged myself again and again. I tisted the Warlord's heart and turned him on his own wretched empire. And each who came after became my puppet. This night as the moon lay between to mounds of cloud a new hand pries me from my last sorry owner.\n\nI beguin slowly, I whisper in the back of her mind.

I will make all your problems go away\" and she held me with cracked fingers and answerd through broken teeth \"Not likely\".\n\nShe clawed and clambored her way out of hell. She drove me into a hundred hearts. Not as an instrument of death, but as if I were a leagth of bottle glass. She didn't kill as a scythe cuts flowers, she vandalised their bodies with cuts. She traded pain and wounds with them till she was standing in a pool of her own blood, laughing! and her enemies where laying in that same mingled pool quiet evermore.\n\nAll the while I promised, I wheedled, I worked her heart with my words. I was ignored! This isn't how it goes, I make them strong, I make them kill all their enemies and their enemies families and their whole damn civilization. And then I make them go on killing till they awake from my dark dream coverd in their lover's blood. They kill one last time and I pass into the hands of another. Over and over, forever and forever!

I killed the bint, and now I'm three bits ritcher\" she explained as to a child. I scoffed! A sword scoff \"I could make you a fortune, money is dust to me. I'll give you the world\" and she laughed \"I have the world, and it's full of scum and some of them will pay to kill the rest. If you offer me a world with more scum you're lying. They're all here\"\n\nShe weilded me for years, my power grew feint, my rage grew dim. She needed me to be easier to hide, so she had my blade cut short. She sold my ruby pommel, and melted down my gold dipped guard. She rewrapped my hilt of human leather with quiet rough linen. Sometimes when it was quiet I became scared, knowing if she ever found a sharper knife I would be tossed away like a boot with a hole in it. But she died before that, as they all die.\n\nI wasn't a warlord's blade now. I was something she made me. A crude knife clutched in her cold and crooked hands.

Aka; the swords job was done, before it got there.\n\nA realist; sure. They could establish there motive, and, be a realistic actor, changing the sword.\n\nA survivalist; definitely. As long as they were fighting for there own survival, they could bring that out in others, or, simply save the world, in order to live.\n\nHowever, a simple, pure, cynicist, is incapable of these actions.\n\nIf they were capable of them, they would not be a cynisist.

However, they are FAR less contradictory, then, the cynisist, and,  a \" incorruptible hero\" , in the same token.\n\nA nhilist? Sure. There is a point where, if things have no meaning, you can argue, that, it's best to make your own.\n\nA realist? Definitely. Those who look at things from multiple viewpoints, and, account for realities \" stacked effects\" , contradictions, and path, is perfectly logical.\n\nBut, a cynisist? Who, by definition, must see the \" darkness\" in things, taking them to it's gloomiest tone, AND, think that realistic is pointless, without reward, and, to seek \" forward motion\" is folly?\n\nNow, THAT , I say, dear sir, is....

{"prompt": "I'd been watching the woman in red for a while now and it had only taken me about half an hour to realise that she was likely in the same line of work as me. In films assassins are ugly, disfigured or tattooed all over but in reality the people who suit it best often fall into one of two different appearances. Either they are average, so incredibly average that you could see them every day for a year and still struggle to describe them, or they are so breathtakingly attractive that people let their guard down around them. The woman in red was definitely, completely the second of these types.\n\n_____\n\nThe well dressed man in the corner had been watching me almost since I'd arrived. I'm very much used to it - first they take a good look at me, think I'm pretty, admire the view. Then some point after that they start to put together little pieces of information; I'm alone, it's a revealing dress, bars like this often have escorts, etc. But even then, you can't just *ask* someone if they're a hooker, can you? What if I'm not? What if I am, but that breaks some kinda unknown etiquette? So in the end, I generally have to make the first move.\n\n_____\n\nAfter ordering herself another drink the woman in red approached my booth. Either she has decided for certain that her mark is a no-show or she thinks I'm the one she's meant to kill and that, that could be very interesting.\n\n\"May I join you?\" She asked and I nodded my agreement.\n\n\"My name's Tessa.\" She offered, briefly resting her purse on the table as she shuffled across.\n\nThe purse was only there for a second before she placed it back by her side but it was more than enough time for me to glance inside.\n\n\"I'm John. Nice gun you've got there.\"\n\nTessa smiled.\n\n\"Well, line of work I'm in it's a useful thing to have. Just in-\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, interrupting without meaning to, \"I think we're in the same line of work.\"\n\n______\n\nI'd only said 'in my line of work' so he had an easy way to ask what I did but as soon as John said that he was an escort too, I felt a little silly for not considering it. This bar is a known place for business men to pick up a little bit of after hours entertainment and John certainly had the looks to be successful. Truth be told, I haven't met a massive amount of male escorts and the ones I have are a little more showy but if you wanted to get fucked by James Bond, John would be perfect.\n\n\"Oh.\" I said and then started to laugh. \"Of course we are. You working tonight then?\"\n\n\"Nope. Not for a while, actually. Bit of a holiday. You?\"\n\nI gestured around the bar.\n\n\"I thought so but look. All groups and couples.\" I thought about it. \"Not that I haven't done couples, but it has to be the *right* couple, you know?\"\n\n_____\n\nI did know. It was very rare that there was a contract for a couple but what happened a little more often was that it didn't really matter if the mark's partner ended up dead or not. And sometimes it's just easier that way and I have to admit that on occasions where the spouse was as messed up as the mark, my trigger finger gets a little itchier on those nights. What Tessa said next though completely threw me.\n\n\"Hm, and I guess it's not like I've never done a group either.\"\n\nWho the hell gets a contract for a whole group? Either it was just that we operated in very different circles or Tessa was considerably better at her job than I am.\n\n\"You must be good.\" I said, just to fill the silence. \"Can't say I've ever done a group.\"\n\nTessa shrugged as she took another sip of her drink.\n\n\"Different clients want different things I guess. And I'm guessing we work with pretty different people. I'm sure you have excellent selling points of your own.\"\n\nYou don't really meet coworkers too often in this line of work so I found myself suddenly falling over myself to impress Tessa.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm not bad. I'm discreet and I'm very, very quick. Nothing gets dragged out with me.\"\n\n_____\n\nI was sipping my whiskey again as John spoke so when he said the word 'quick' it was an effort not to splutter. Discreet makes sense but *quick?* I've never had a client ask if we could somehow take less time and I can't say that it's something I've ever wanted either.\n\n\"How... nice for you.\" I said, but not overly convincingly and he instantly noticed. \"Sorry, it's just not something that's ever been requested of me, to speed things along. Different clients, as I said. Most of mine seem to think that more time means they got more of their money's worth, I find.\"\n\nJohn looked confused.\n\n\"You make it last longer than it needs to?\"\n\n\"Well, that's a matter of perspective. I make it last however long the client wants. Not to mention, sometimes there are requests for things that aren't super fast. You know, whips, handcuffs, et cetera.\"\n\n_____\n\nI'm not naive, I knew that whilst most assassins are contracted just to kill there are those who deal with requests that include torture. But they're a rare breed and I honestly didn't think I'd ever meet one. But here Tessa was, talking about drawn out deaths and whipping her marks in an easy, carefree manner that left me reeling.\n\"Is that all in a day's work for you?\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Of course! Do you seriously never get requests like that?\"\n\n\"No. They generally want me fast, discreet and invisible.\"\n\nTessa looked at me sympathetically.\n\n\"Oh, it's like that. People's attitudes about this are so backwards sometimes.\"\n\n\"I guess?\" I said, although I really didn't quite know what she meant. \"I think perhaps you have a different experience, maybe you're just recommended for people who want the weird stuff.\"\n\nShe bristled at this and drew back away from me ever so slightly.\n\n\"It's not like that. Very little of what I do is 'weird' and frankly I think that's a very backwards term for someone like you to be using anyway. Most times it's just fucking.\"\n\n_____\n\nJohn looked at me strangely.\n\n\"You have sex with all of them?\"\n\nThe question threw me for a loop.\n\n\"Well I guess technically not all, sometimes a client realises that's not what they really want or...\" I trailed off as I realised what he meant. \"You don't at all, do you? Shit, you aren't an escort.\"\n\nJohn laughed so hard the table shook and after the increasing levels of unease that laughter was infectious. Soon, I was giggling alongside him, both of us breaking into fresh bouts of laughter whenever we met the other's eyes.\n\n\"Oh god, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything - I just thought you were like me. You're probably awesome as an escort.\"\n\n\"Hey, what is it *you* thought we both did then? What's your job?\"\n\nJohn smirked.\n\n\"Librarian?\" He suggested and then shook his head when it was clear I was having none of it. \n\"Nah, sorry. I'm a hitman. I kill people for money.\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has potential, but there are some areas that need work. First, you need to work on your dialogue.

Jorge had never heard such a thing, if you didn't count sexually fucked up serial killer podcast explanations.\n\n\"I don't even know what to say to that...\" Jorge muttered.\n\n\"Don't be such a prude, you're telling me you've never gotten off on the job? Neither of the two clients turned you on at all?\" Lane asked, teasing. Lane chewed on the end of the thin stir-straw in another almost-empty glass in a long line of empty glasses. Slow nights in the hotel were the worst.\n\n\"That's not...I don't...\" Jorge tried to think. Lane sounded weird, and sloppy. That kind of behavior on a job could reveal them BOTH and Jorge had no intention to be busted for his own \"little black book list\", small body count or not.\n\n\"That's not what I do it for.\" Jorge finally said.\n\nLane sighed, chewing on the stir-straw and eyeing a plain looking man at the end of the bar. Middle aged, salt-and-pepper hair, no jewelry. Clothes were fashionable but not ritzy; nothing spoke to Jorge that identified this man as a wealthy or political mark. What was Lane's game? Just go around and do whoever? \n\n\"Honey, it ain't always about the money.\" Lane said, tossing Jorge a kiss before sauntering over to the boring man. \n\n\"Who the fuck trained you?\" Jorge muttered to the empty seat beside him, horrified by Lane's open approach of the client and planning a smooth exit of his own.

The classical helped me think things through, and it's amazing how often a situation can be defused by some quick thinking.\n\nI'd immediately had to switch to my DDR playlist when I found myself dodging a swiftly thrown car moments after my arrival.  I always felt a little lacking immediately after switching to something other than classical, but I desperately needed the speed boost.  It's the only reason I survived the next few minutes of utter chaos.  I had yet to even see my opponent.  It was merely me, trying desperately to avoid the varied, insanely heavy items thrown at me in an almost constant stream.

Music connects us in visceral ways, and people from across the globe from each other can genuinely connect and feel empathy for one another when listening to something unfamiliar with either of them.  Music reminds us of our common humanity.  \n\nMusic is power.  It is the driving force that unites movements and defines generations.  I don't mean in just the cultural touchstone sense, either.  It is very real power.  Psychic, metaphysical power.  I am able to open myself to that power, to that flow.  Since I was little, music allowed me to do things that baffled my parents.  A simple soothing voice humming dropped me to restful healing sleep instantly.  Singing along in the car to my dad's \u201croad songs\u201d, and we'd somehow wind up where we were going hours early.  My school's fight song had my football team winning championships left and right, though it was a bit of a challenge to get the band director to play it before the touchdown.  \n\nThe older I've become, the more I've realized that my powers can be tailored.  I can boost my speed and power with battle hymns and old martial music.  A dangerous and frantic crowd is no match for my calming presence while playing a string quartet's  light etude.  I have even used the US Air Force's official song to boost me over a swollen river to rescue some stranded hikers in danger of being washed away.  I didn't set out to be a superhero, but I just kind of fell into it, playing the music and getting things done.  I think perhaps these powers are only really at their apex because of technology.  I can play music in earbuds from a vast remote library of stuff I have collected.  Meticulous sorting and indexing helps me switch rapidly, and my own love of music helps me remember songs to sing to myself and get pumped when electronics fail.  \n\nI don't let on that the music powers me.  I've graduated, so to speak, from fighting natural disasters and cats in trees to the actual villains running roughshod through the world.  No need to let them know that without music, without the ability even to sing, or drum, or connect to that power, I'm fairly normal.  My superhero name is Steve.  It has nothing to do with music, and really, who wants a name like \u201cThe Tune\u201d, or \u201cMusic Man\u201d, or (as my smart-ass dad once suggested) \u201cHero who can't remember to take the garbage out\u201d?\n\nThis job, for what it's worth as a job, has gotten harder, you know.  Tailoring the music to the villain and the situation is always a challenge.  I show up and start rocking through some metal and thrash music, and villains stop showing up to fight.  They send henchmen, or even worse, unwilling proxies.  Keeping my head on a swivel while I try not to hurt those who have been duped, looking for the real threat to adjust a playlist on the fly isn't easy.  Switching from a classical aria to help focus my wits to get me deep inside a hideout to a gospel hymn of protection when bullets start to fly takes a lot of concentration and skill.\n\nBut there was that one... thing.  Villain, yes.  Man?  Woman?  I don't think it was really either.  Someone had made a pact or agreement with something out of time and space.  Something Lovecraftian and eldritch.  It didn't follow the rules of villainy.  No speeches.  No monologuing.  It didn't really conquer, so much as enslave, then consume.  By the time people were really aware of how awful this thing was, it had metastasized into a constantly-shifting mass that exerted its twisted will through psychic and physical force.  One minute, it might be a towering being with flailing tentacles, and another, it might be an manifestation of wind and power, sucking energy out of nearby sources.\n\nHow do you fight something like that?  It had to be stopped, and it was obvious that I had to try.  I had flown there on a raft of Air Force service songs and marches.  I even hurried my way with some sci-fi speed music (Star Trek themes are great for warping along).  Moving as fast as I was, I punched through it like a me-sized bullet, tearing a great gout of blackness out of it.  Then I was on the ground, covered in that blackness, feeling my will draining out of me.  I had to switch to some of my favorite motivational songs, the ones that get clubs jumping, just to stand up and untangle myself.  By the time I had, it was aware of me and moving at me.  \n\nTentacles and thrown objects rained down around me, and I had to get defensive just to survive the onslaught.  I tried my blackest metal to get in fast and try to destroy its physical form.  It evanesced into steam and lightning and attacked me with energy, all while trying to erode my mind.  I needed something that would let me fight this thing back with my mind, but also physically.  It was far more powerful than any foe I'd faced yet.  It could switch its form and mode on a whim, and did so.  For every foot-stomping bluegrass banger to get me motivated and every Mongolian throat-singing metal tune to infuse me with power, this thing just morphed into something different.  I could only switch music so fast, and I was running out of ideas.\n\nOnce, years ago, I had hurt a man, badly.  Well, more than hurt.  I was new to using my powers directly against villains, and I had faced some with powers of their own.  He was strong, he was evil, and he had killed many in his quest for power.  He was trying to kill me, and also a bunch of schoolkids.  In trying to find music to keep the kids happy while keeping myself strong enough to fight him off, I stumbled on what I now call my 'forbidden playlist\u201d.  I never wanted to repeat what had happened to that man.  Evil or no, it was too much.  \n\nTaking a bit of parking garage upside my head while blasting power ballads spun me ass over tea kettle, and I knew it was time.  This thing wasn't human so far as I could tell, and it was winning.  I cycled through the list, and \u201cThe Merry Go Round Broke Down\u201d soared through the speakers in my head.  Anvils rained down on the beast.  Before it could adjust, I had assumed its own form, but with exaggerated eyelashes, a feminine shape, and huge red lips.  I kissed it.  It boggled mentally.  The \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d theme blasted and I forced it to chase me into power lines.  Despite lacking solid form, the outline of a skeleton shone from within.  \n\nCartoons are barely-controlled insanity.  They represent the ability of the human mind to create the most absurd situations and precepts, often lacking even the need for dialogue.  The music sets the theme and the action, and we are caught happily in the tumble of farce and suspended physics.  This thing was caught in the maelstrom, and faced with something as fickle as its own nature, was being defeated.  Acid-squirting flowers and ridiculously huge cannons pelted it.  It fell through holes where there should be none.  And when last I saw it, it was riding a giant rocket straight into the sun.  The sunsets were pretty for about a week after that.  \n\nNo mortal can stand the tide of the collected madness of mankind, and I refuse to subject them to it, no matter how debased a villain might be.  But should the need arise, Steve is here to let 'em know: That's all, Folks.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening paragraph of your story is very strong. You immediately set up a contrast between the engineering and science of the modern world and the power of music. You also establish a clear thesis - that music has the power to connect us to generations past and to our common humanity. This is a great start to your story.\n\nHowever, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be revised for clarity. You introduced the idea that music has real, metaphysical power - which is intriguing - but then you jump into examples of this power without sufficient explanation. It might be helpful to provide a bit more context for the reader before giving specific examples.\n\nThe third paragraph is much better in this regard. You provide clear examples of how you have used your musical powers to help others. This is much easier for the reader to follow.\n\nYou have a strong voice and an interesting premise for your story. I think with a bit of fine-tuning, it could be even stronger."}

However, the story starts to lose steam in the middle. The dialogue is choppy and the exposition is heavy-handed.

I suggest you work on streamlining the middle section, and focus on making the dialogue more natural. You have a lot of potential as a writer, and I think with some practice you could produce some really great work."}

This story is full of well-choreographed violence and intense dialogue. You did a great job of making the reader feel the tension and excitement of the fight.\n\nNow, for the areas where you can improve: first, your story is very short. While there is nothing wrong with writing a short story, in this case, it feels like the story is incomplete. Perhaps you could flesh it out a bit more, explore the characters and their motivations a bit more deeply.\n\nSecond, your prose is very straightforward. There is nothing wrong with this, but it does make the story feel a bit flat. You could try spicing up your language a bit, using more figurative language and descriptive adjectives. This would help to create a more immersive and interesting reading experience."}

From the rubble, became an old western town.

You have a unique voice and style, and I think with a little bit of refinement, your story could be even better. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Try to be more concise in your writing. For example, in the first paragraph, you could cut out the sentence \" mainly dance, for me, it was more factual that it made me do more.\" This would tighten up your writing and make it more efficient.\n\n2. In general, try to be more concise with your adjectives and adverbs. For example, in the sentence \"My adversary chuckled as he loomed over me, his hand raised to finish me off in one go,\" you could cut out the word \"chuckled.\" This would give the sentence more impact and make it more efficient.\n\n3. Pay attention to your sentence structure. For example, in the sentence \"It was true, my playlist looped back to 'Lose Yourself' by Eminem and my body began to relax as the opening came through,\" you could switch the order of the clauses to make the sentence more interesting. Try something like, \"My body began to relax as the opening to 'Lose Yourself' by Eminem came through, and it was then that I realized my playlist had looped back to the beginning.\" This would give the sentence more impact and make it more interesting to read.\n\n4. Make sure your dialogue sounds natural. For example, in the sentence, \" 'You'll never beat me, I studied your playlists and knew exactly when to strike. When you looped back to your starter song!' ,\" the dialogue feels a bit stilted. Try to make it sound more natural by reading it aloud to yourself.\n\n5. Pay attention to your word choice. For example, in the sentence, \"I had a few hours, enough time to patch myself up,\" you could replace the word \"patch\" with a more specific verb, such as \"tend.\" This would give the sentence more impact and make it more interesting to read.\n\nKeep up the good work, and I look forward to reading more of your stories."}
{"prompt": "No tactic presented itself to be fitting, no strategy dented the massive head of the supervillain. Not even the most dissonant chords, not even the highest or lowest notes imaginable, not even the shrieks of leger line swords trying again and again to penetrate the impenetrable barriers of this villain's scaly skin. The villain's lungs were nonexistent, replaced with fishy gills that flopped around, destroying buildings all around. The villain was a blue-tinged creature, choking and flopping around with an evil intent. The villain... was a gigantic, fifty-feet tall, fish. \n  \nI had enjoyed fish. I had bitten into the flesh of fish, enjoying the flavor and the texture of fish flesh. Oh- how I wish I could do so with this tone-deaf mass of a fish, vibrating and making that horrid bubbling noise from deep inside its throat. The horrid music- no, not even music. Noises. Noises of the dying yet destructive fish obstructed the sounds my earpieces let out. Ah, my earpieces. My precious earpieces that presented itself with a surprising array of music. The music supplied a sort of catalyst, enzymes, to boost my intelligence (with the musical delights of \"dead guy music\"), to make me strong as The Rock with rock music, to make me fluent in Korean with Kpop music, EDM to make my technological information higher, and oh so many wonderful pieces of my choosing. They should have worked. Every time there was a catastrophic disaster of some existence, the music of my earpieces have soothed me with high, unlimited powers. I had been able to destroy dinosaurs (with music based on meteors, of course) and destroy the greatest evil madman there was (Songs of the power of love... how nice, you see.) However, its dependability dwindled with the emergence of the evil, ginormous fish. \n  \nThe fish flopped around with its horrendous noises unfit for any human to listen to, not even the most significantly renounced marine biologists. \"Ugh, how disgustingly revolting,\" I told myself, switching the currently inaudible playlist to the Aquarium of Saint Saens Carnival of the Animals, hoping it would give some vital clue to how to defeat and hopefully consume the fish before me. Unluckily, the music did absolutely nothing. It was hardly heard, for there was too much flopping and gurgling of the fish, but all else it did was a heightened awareness to the fish. The fish still flopped around, eliciting fearful screams and falling buildings. I walked myself back, for there was no use staying too close to the fish. \n  \n\"Curses to my cursed earpieces, equivalent of rotten earwax. I do wonder if they even work at all,\" I cursed, fearfully, attempting repeatedly to obtain a useful power from my earpieces. Nothing seemed to work, and everything was too complex to be able to overcome the fearful blurblike dialogues of the fish. Frustration started to pent up in my heart, for this was never how things had ever gone. Something had always showed up, something had always worked. \n  \n\"Oh no, oh no,\" I thought to myself, looking frantically at the fish. The fishy creature had looked suffering, dying, moments ago, but now it seemed to have a greater and increased vitality. The fish flopped around a lot quicker than before, jumping higher and higher. Somehow, the highest buildings started to fall. My heart beat faster and harder, and I thought my body was shaking from the tremors. My mental state went blank.\n  \nBut that could not go on, because I was the designated hero of the city.\n  \nI needed a plan, a backup plan. Did I have a backup plan?\n  \n\"Oh yes, a backup plan. The backup plan, that was the...\" I muttered to myself, suddenly remembering my \"backup plan.\"\n  \nI nervously laughed. The backup plan was the \"forbidden playlist\". \n  \nThe forbidden playlist... it was a loop of the countless variations of one singular song. \n  \nCould this work?\n  \nI clicked my way through my earpiece with one strand of hope. \n  \nYes, I found it- the forbidden song's loop. \n  \nI clicked, and the music played out through the air, vibrating my auditory ossicles and vibrating my brain. The sound was much, much louder than ever before. The gurgling sounds of I trembled at the monstrous dominance of the music, and suddenly, I felt a tremendous change within me. \n  \nMy head changed into a circular, yellow shark's head, cute enough to daze even the evilest evil lords of any fantasy novel. My arms became extremely strong and stiff, extending into two chopstick-like arms. Then, I started dancing and singing. \n  \n\"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo Baby shark,\" I sang in perfect pitch, turning and clapping my arms this way and that. The whole city stopped to watch me, and the evil fish stopped flopping around, obviously in awe of my spectacular dancing. The verses went on, and I realized that this song was the perfect fit for this fish. I had not thought of the fact that sharks ate fish. This meant I could walk on and consume the fish at my will. At this realization, I walked towards the now-unmoving fish almost-corpse. My arms had changed into limbs as strong as shark jaws, and were layered with teeth, like lampreys. The fish looked at me in terror, and sluggishly squirmed to hide between whatever it thought of. Resistance was futile. My arms clamped on the gigantic fish, and suddenly the fish was dead. \n  \n\n  \nAs I saw the fish disintigrate into individual sashimi cuts, the baby shark fascade faded, finally. I collapsed on the floor into a tired mess, my eyes closing into silent oblivion.\n  \n\n  \n\\---\n  \n\n  \nTime passed, and I awoke many hours later by a small young child poking my nose softly. My eyes slowly opened to find two smiling innocent eyes staring into my soul.\n  \n\"Big sibling, that was the coolest thing ever,\" the child said in awe. I stood up and patted the young toddler.

For example, in the second paragraph, it would be better to describe the different types of people you've stopped, rather than just listing them.\n\nThird, the story feels a bit choppy in places.

{"prompt": "\"Is that all, then?\" She asked dryly, the clicking of her heels slowly getting louder as she approached. The sting in her voice was noticeable, yet understated, in a way that only posh British accents can be.\n\nI glance at my phone, its cracked screen flickering, dozens of fine-lined cobwebs crawling across the UI of my Spotify playlist. It's hard to see the songs at this point, so I just hit the big \"shuffle\" button and hope it lands on something good.\n\nIt's Aerosmith. Not my cup of tea, but rock is rock. I've tried other genres, but they don't work as well.\n\nFor example, jazz makes turns me invisible. But it only with Kenny G songs, and you have to get completely naked for it to work. Even then, you can't really hide the headphones, so it's a mostly useless power.\n\nPop-music, especially early to mid 2000's pop, gives me the laser vision, but it's really difficult to control and boy, if it doesn't sap the energy right out of you. Really, it's just a one-off thing, and more of a last resort than anything else.\n\nK-pop, weirdly enough, gives me an ultra-heightened sense of smell. It's very particular, and very unpleasant. Especially in crowded areas on hot days. Everything is just so... *amplified*.\n\nSo rock it is.\n\nI hear the guitar chords and drums, vocals too, the lyrics unimportant, sounds of a bygone era swelling in my ears, its arrival not over-appreciated but not entirely unwelcome, either. I need it, after all.\n\nAs the music crescendos, its pitch rising and falling, the tempo crawling steadily and then whizzing forward, so too does my power level, my strength in sync with the dizzying fluctuations of speed and intensity.\n\nA familiar power settles into my bones, and I shift my weight into my front foot, raising two balled fists on either side of my temple, ready to fight again, but not really. I shuffle in the direction of my opponent, listlessly, crossing my feet as I try desperately not to fall face forward into the pavement.\n\nI do listen to Classical every once in a while. It makes me smarter. Whenever I put that on, it's as if the clouds in my head part, and everything seems so much simpler. But when I tried putting on some Mozart earlier, every instinct was telling me to run away and hide. I guess that is the smartest choice.\n\nMy uneven breaths make a crisp crackling sound, almost diseased sounding. Warm blood trickles from the corner of my mouth. I swipe away at it, lazily, with the back of my hand. It keeps coming back.\n\nAs my eyes slowly rise to meet hers, this woman, who looked like a corporate receptionist, in her stuffy blue-gray suit, now appeared 3 times bigger. A demon, even, her towering, dark shape indistinct in the blurry heat waves reflecting off of the concrete. I blink, and she's normal sized again.\n\n\"Damn. This is bad\", I think to myself, but in my delirium I fail to notice her bend down, shifting her weight into her lead leg, the ground splintering beneath her feet. In a split second, she explodes forward, a dull, thudding \"boom\" sound escaping from behind her.\n\nBefore my brain can register what is happening, I am smashed into the pavement, the force of our collision sending a large plume of brown dust shooting upward and then falling back down slowly.\n\nWhen the dust clears, I see that she's on top of me now. How, I'm not sure. She was just over there, and now she's here.\n\nHer hands are around my neck. She begins to crush my windpipe, her strength like an industrial piston. I realize she's knocked my headphones out of my ears. Out of the corner of my eye I can see them, and my phone, but it's shattered into pieces.\n\nI look up at her. She's completely expressionless. Bored, maybe.\n\n\"What *are* you?\", I think, but my vision is fading now. As her face slowly goes out of focus, and the world starts to get dimmer, my mind drifts back to the day I discovered my powers.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are some areas that could use some work.

I knew she couldn't, her top speed had never even reached Mach 1 but there was no time to explain, I marched the three steps to her side and snatched them right off her head, honey-blonde hair exploding outwards as it was freed from the straps.\n\nGods I love it when she lets her hair down.\n\nShe wasn't much smaller than me thankfully, the protective eyewear only needed a quick pull to tighten.  I ordered Rock Lock to break the window as my fingers moved to my left wrist, dancing over the touchscreen that held my 'soundtrack to victory'.  I moved past my usual forte - rock, metal, techno, even a few pop songs when appropriate - and hit the big, black button.  A voice came from my earpieces, asking for confirmation.\n\n\"Confirm, situation Omega Black.  Passphrase, 'never gonna give you up'.\"\n\nMy teammates gasped, except for Jet, who frowned and raised a hand like she wanted to slap me.

Hesitantly, you press play on the first track.\nThe first one is made by someone called \"S3RL\". \"Weird name\", you think, as the song starts. It's a simple tune, with most of the beats being anime moans and a remixed TTS voice singing how much they wanted a \"hentai girl\". \nAs expected, the first effect instantly happens, and it's just your lungs oxygenating your blood way faster, allowing you to dodge the villain's attacks and lasting way longer than normal.\nThe second song is pure madness. Extremely violent beats combined with a demonic voice screaming in Latin makes your blood literally boil, allowing for very hot and pressured blood beams to emerge at will, breaking the villain attack.\nThe third is more calm, yet threatening, made by a \"Mori\". Just a rap base with a female voice rapping and asking in a gentle manner if \"you could excuse her and RIP\". This effect made your brain almost overload, making you see in slow motion.\nThe fourth one is more degenerate, composed of a cover of the song \"Despacito\" entirely of anime moans and pleasure screams. The effect was very unexpected, since it solidified the blood flow on your arms and in your \"lil' buddy\" making it a very resistant makeshift meat sword, albeit still painful after each hit.\nThe fifth and last was just soft anime moans over a silent background. This one your weeb friend sent you so you could relax a little.

My Grandma, the person that more that anyone I was close to died. And in the middle of my parents devours I was not in a good head space. But my mom refused to let me stay home from school. So Monday morning I packed my undone homework. And went off to school. \n\nI shared my first period with Antony. It was math. As we walked into class I saw the look he gave me. The look that told me that he was looking forward to the next chapter of the pirate story I was spinning for him, and myself. I sat down and the teacher started to drown on and on about fractions of something, I wasn\u2019t listening. I tried to start my story. \n\n\u201cAnd the pirate queen rose from her throne. And stared down at Henry and said\u2026 and said\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t think of the next thing to say. Tears started to come to my eyes and I just wanted to run. Without thinking I stood up and ran out of the class room. I knew I would get detention but I didn\u2019t care. Nether would my parents. I wanted to run far far away to one of my stores. To just not have to deal with the shitty hand life dealt me. But I settled for a tree in the play yard. I slumped down and held my eyes in my nees begging for some magic Fairy God mother to fix my problems but nothing changed I wasn\u2019t transportation to my stories. I was startled when there was a tap on my shoulder and looked up. There was Anthony sitting next to me. \n\n\u201cYour  Grandma died this weekend\u201d he said  \u201cyour not handling well I see.\u201d \n\u201cYah\u201d I responded through broken sobs \u201cI loved her\u201d \n\u201cDo you want to talk about it\u201d \n\u201cNo\u201d\nSo we sat there side by side until the security came and got us and forced us back in to the class. At lunch Anthony pulled out a book from his backpack and handed it to me. There was my name on the cover.\n\u201cI made a book of your best stories and thought you would like a copy\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed in this story is the use of present tense throughout. This creates a sense of immediacy and keeps the reader engaged. However, there are some places where the tense feels a bit off. For example, in the sentence \"I knew Anthony was a mind reader. Long before he told me,\" it would make more sense to say \"I knew Anthony was a mind reader long before he told me.\" This small change will help to create a more consistent tense throughout the story.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is the use of dialogue. The dialogue in this story is well done and adds to the story. However, there are a few places where the dialogue feels a bit choppy. For example, in the conversation between the protagonist and Anthony, there is a line of dialogue that just says \"Yah.\" This feels out of place and disrupts the flow of the conversation. A small change, such as having the protagonist say \"Yes,\" would help to make the dialogue feel more natural.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written story. The use of present tense creates a sense of immediacy, and the dialogue is well done. There are a few places where the tense feels a bit off and the dialogue feels a bit choppy, but these are small issues that can be easily fixed."}
{"prompt": "Everyday feels like blinking into a different universe, having my soul scattered throughout time and space. Everyone has thoughts, not all of them are interesting, but there is one channel I tune into everyday. One channel that I devote time and energy into tuning into. \n\nChannel Thuy. \n\nYou see, Channel Thuy has an ongoing story that is worth the watch. Every week, Monday through Friday for one hour before lunch during Homeroom she\u2019s been running her own fantasy story that has been going on for well over two years now, the characters really pull you in and the setting of Mordreem is fantastical and expansive. \n\nSo far, we gotten to what I\u2019ve been calling the Season Finale. She\u2019s reached a tough point, where her main character, Lynn, is at a moral and emotional fork in the road. \n\nEverything has pointed Lynn to avenging her family\u2019s death, defeating the Demon King Mondo, restoring peace and balance to the world and being able to settle down and - and- \n\nWell, that\u2019s it. Lynn doesn\u2019t know what to do after all this. Her whole life she\u2019s been focused on revenge. She realizes, after something that could only be considered Lynn falling into a rabbit hole and living her life normally with her family still alive, that she could never be normal. She has grown used to the path of revenge and accepted that in order to defeat Mondo that she must kill him, so that his toxicity can not linger and infest the planet. \n\nShe\u2019s thinking. She\u2019s been thinking about this same question for weeks now. Should she do that? Well, of course, it is for the good of her soul and the world that all the evil in Mordreem must be vanquished. She alone must do it to truly avenge her family. What about Lynn, though? What will she have to live for afterwards? She has lived the life of a lonely orphan Swordmaster for years, there\u2019s nothing more she can do. \n\nIt isn\u2019t like she could go home to a husband, make bread and butter and live domestically. Lynn is disappointed with her future and her past. \n\nWhat could ever change her mind?\n\nThuy is looking up now, answering a question from the professor. She is, of course, correct. She\u2019s been stressed out about her own life and what she should do with herself after high school. Thuy has always been a very friendly and almost popular person her whole life, she\u2019s not top of our class, but she is graduating with most of her honors, and her parents own the best restaurant in the city. \n\nI\u2019ve known Thuy ever since we were children. She never gets stuck like this with her brain plots. Not even in middle school when she had this odd obsession with killing off her main characters. No, it always fit the plot; Thuy always made sense and it was why I loved reading her thoughts. She was enigmatic and emotional, yet practical and realistic. At least, her brain was. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to talk to her and make friends before, but was always guarded and unintentionally kept to herself and her groups. She didn\u2019t have time to talk to me. I was the only kid in a private school who was a loner and many of my peers considered me controversial for being outspoken (hence, WHY I am a loner). \n\nThuy is also my neighbor and she used to be my best friend when we were younger. She and I used to play Princesses at my tree house or Mermaids in her swimming pool. We stopped being friends as soon as middle school started. When I was able to finally transfer to the same school as her. Before we were so excited by it, and we even planned our whole academic lives together. As soon as we got into the school building, we stopped being friends. It felt almost immediate, but it wasn\u2019t. \n\nI understand, but it only makes it all the more difficult being able to read not only Thuy\u2019s mind, but everyone else. I became very distant from others, because why be their friends when I can just read their inner most workings?\n\nLynn is back at her crossroads. Channel Thuy is back to her regularly scheduled program, folks. \n\nShe\u2019s recapping her last thoughts. She keeps doing this, where it feels like filler thoughts that lead up to the same question, and lately, has been coming to a disappointing answer. There is nothing about Lynn\u2019s life that she wants to live for once her revenge is sought out. \n\nJust then, Thuy makes eye contact with me. I can hear her thoughts. I know what she thinks about me, normally she doesn\u2019t think much about me at all. This time though, all I feel in her head is nostalgia back to when we played our games together. \n\nLynn is back, and as she starts to head towards Mondo\u2019s castle there\u2019s a melody coming from the swamp marshes around her. A siren\u2019s lamenting tale is pulling Lynn away, it is then that Lynn\u2019s eyes open wide.\n\nAnother filler episode. Great. Thanks, Thuy.\n\n\n\u2026\n        All I can hear, much like an echo through space is Thuy\u2019s voice. \u201cAt least I\u2019m more creative than you, Alice.\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed in your story is that it is very choppy and difficult to follow. You have a lot of information in there that is not necessary to the story. For example, the entire section about Thuy's life and her thoughts about you are not needed and only serve to confuse the reader. You also have a lot of information about Lynn's backstory and the world she lives in that is not necessary to the plot of the story.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with your story is that it is very difficult to follow. You need to work on making your transitions smoother and your plot more clear. Additionally, you need to work on your dialogue. The dialogue in your story is very stilted and unnatural.\n\n Overall, your story has potential but it needs a lot of work. I suggest you focus on simplifying your plot and making your dialogue more natural."}
{"prompt": "There\u2019s a kid in my class who is a closeted writer. Jamie writes stories during lessons, sometimes even during tests. It\u2019s somewhat distracting, even though he sits across the room from me. Because I, am a mind reader.\n\nToday, Jamie is writing about a couple of his recurring characters - a self insert and an obscure superhero I never heard of. Or maybe the superhero is one of his OCs, who can say? The tale of the caped vigilante and himself never are actually about fighting crime. Instead, they are typically super slice of life where catching bad guys was almost an afterthought. \n\nFor example, last week they went out to dinner that was secretly a stake out, only to discover their target had pickpocketed them without their notice. Now, in a continuation of that storyline, the two are trying to figure out how to pay for dinner while also pursuing the target. \n\nThe most obvious answer - split up, didn\u2019t seem to have enough stakes. There\u2019s no tension in choosing both options. I listened to Jamie toy with having them both go after the target or both do something like the dishes to pay for dinner. Neither felt very satisfying. \n\nSuddenly, a spark of inspiration hit me. It was such a good idea, I had to resist walking over and telling him that very instant. Mostly because he hadn\u2019t written any of his story down (at least during class) and I would have no way of knowing about it besides mind reading. How could I let him know how to fix his story, without letting him know I am aware of his story?\n\nI decided to try telling my friend a fake story in earshot of Jamie, in hopes he uses it as inspiration. When Jamie is in earshot, I find a friend from my track team and begin my tale.\n\n\u201cDo you know what crazy thing happened to me last week?\u201d She voiced her dissent. From the corner of my mind, I could tell Jamie was listening, but not intentionally.\n\n\u201cMy family went out for dinner at that restaurant with the good Thai food, but right as our meal was getting served, a couple was caught trying to eat and run.\u201d\n\nHer mouth dropped open in surprise, \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nJamie was fully eavesdropping at this point. All according to plan.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I nod. \u201cThey were being all subtle about it to, but then one of the people waiting to be seated called out to the hostess that they didn\u2019t pay. They freeze for a second, deer in the headlight style before they book it out of the building. A couple of the wait staff chased them around the parking lot, it was wild.\u201d\n\nI could already hear Jamie adding his own twist on the narrative. The stake out target alerting staff of a potential dine and dash. The restaurant chasing the dynamic duo while they in turn pursue their target.\n\nIt was all coming together nicely. A little too nicely. From that day on, I could feel Jamie be suspicious of me being a mind reader. It\u2019s not like I could tell him and expose my secret to the whole school. \n\nThe more i noticed him watching me, the more convinced I was that he would keep it a secret if it slipped out. None of my track friends knew. As much as I cared about them, none of them were particularly good secret keepers. Jamie, though, was the quiet sort who minded his own business. I liked that about him. \n\nr/bluestarsshatter\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: this is a small prequel from my My Girlfriend is a Mind Reader story you can read here on reddit\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story is intriguing and well-written.

{"prompt": "Every day I drink to the point that I can tolerate being around the fools around me. Not that I do.\n\nWizards? They are more like kittens playing around with yarn--it would be impossible to make them understand that what they're playing around with was not created solely for the purpose of their entertainment. As for me, I am different. I need to know where magic comes from, and I need to understand how it ended up in Stokacenor.\n\nI uncork another bottle, swiggle it around a little to wake up its contents, and I gorge myself with its contents. If it doesn't burn, you aren't drinking. You have to throw yourself into it with wild abandon because that is how you must face all things if you are to become the greatest wizard the world has ever seen. The smash of the bottle against the wall is a lovely sound. \"Sifieridum Maloceotris!\" The shards of glass reassemble themselves, hovering up into the air; the reflected light from the moon is visible in them to my great delight. I clear my throat. \"Chivborodum Magnisodesis!\" A sweet glug, glug, glug as the bottle fills. A red delight! All mine! Wine is a wonder and an unlimited supply of it? It almost makes it worth it, having put up with those insufferable scrotums prancing about in the 'Academy.'\n\nThe bottle hovers towards me and I stick out my tongue but my eyes are fastened on the page of the book in front of me. It's an old one. I had to break out Tier 5 magic just to make it somewhat readable. But its contents are all knew to me. 'The Heroic Struggles of Durn Blurn,' said the title and I scratched my long beard for a long while before deciding to check it out. That is another of my fine qualities: I search where others have not. So I learn what others never will.\n\n&gt; Durn Blurn was once an eyelash drifting around in the emptiness of space. Eons earlier he had fallen from his brethren comprising the left brow of the great Sacter. Durn Blurn drifted, and drifted, and drifted, until he fell into a rift. That rift was a portal to Stokacenor.\n\nI let drops of wine fall onto my tongue and I sip them up much like how a cat would. Sacter? The Initial Being? I have never heard this story before.\n\n&gt; Durn Blurn did not at first understand the world he had landed in. Where was all the magic?\n\nA ripple of delight flashes through me. Now we're getting somewhere!\n\n&gt; \"Magic not be in here place?\" asked Durn Blurn. \"But of reason why?\" He eyelashed all through the realm, seeing strange sights, and he came to realize that he had ended up a magic-free pocket of existence. Durn Blurn decided he would change things. \"Be magic,\" he said and Stokacenor was transformed. He thought for a long time before deciding on some spells. First, he invented Blogorandium Sifarilosi. \"Upside time,\" he said.\n\n... What? Blogorandium Sifarilosi is a Tier 3 levitation spell.\n\n&gt; Durn Blurn levitated across the realm until he stumbled on a little girl crying. \"What tears about?\" he wondered. He then saw a broken cup. Ah; entropy. A familiar scourge. Durn Blurn sagely created a spell to mend the problem, \"Not broke.\" We know it better, of course, as Sifieridum Maloceotris.\n\nThis is strange stuff. For a moment I just stare at the pages. I turn my head to see that I have spilled my wine on the floor of my study. \"Sifieridum Malo--\"\n\nIt feels ... strange. This book cannot be true, can it? Am I supposed to be believe these great spells have stupid meanings like that? And they were invented by an ... eyelash?\n\nI cast the spell and the wine slurps its way back into the bottle. I feel uneasy.\n\n&gt; Durn Blurn wanted to know about the problems of these strange creatures, so he created the spell Mifieroaenis Cilorefhax Bh'o. \"Durn Blurn time,\" he said. Any creature wishing to consult him could do so using the spell. Durn Blurn felt very pleased with himself.\n\nMaybe I would try it out, just as a joke? I looked around. No one's here. I opened my door. No one there either. I looked out the window. All clear. It's not silly if I'm just doing it as a joke. \"Mifieroaenis Cilorefax Bh'o!\"\n\nAs I expected, nothing happened. Of course. What was I thinking? This was just a book written for amusement, which was why no one but me had bothered to read it. I wasted my time with the most stupid things! Why didn't I just spend this day procrastinating instead?\n\n\"Durn Blurn time?\"\n\nThe most hideous man I had ever laid my eyes on stood right before me. I screamed.\n\n\"No big ear sounds. Durn Blurn sensitive ears. Small sound better.\"\n\nThe grotesque creature before me ... Could it be? Was it truly ...?\n\n\"Durn Blurn book! Very of good reading.\" The man made a wild grimace and gave me two thumbs up. He laughed. \"Shocked why so handsome?\" The beast *pouted*. \"Be so handsome spell,\" he explained.\n\n\"Chivborodum Magnisodesis!\" I cried. I was going to need more wine. Much more wine.\n\nTBC\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " You have a very interesting and unique writing style, and I enjoy reading your work.

{"prompt": "It makes sense in practice. The code of the spells is tied to elements and location. Most people assume that the spell is creating effects. Magic makes you fly, magic becomes fire, but that\u2019s just not true. I am writing this all down because\u2026\n  \n\n  \nI look up from my journal, hearing footsteps approaching my door, \u201cOh hells.\u201d I grab my book and leap out the window, speaking arcane gibberish which roughly translates to \u201cWall is Floor\u201d reorienting my gravity to the wall of the building and running up it.\n  \n\n  \nAh, just as I assumed. The arcanists chasing me cast a fly spell to rush after me, but it makes them vulnerable to gravity manipulation as long as they aren\u2019t oriented to the floor. I cast the same spell.\n  \n\n  \nNow, can anyone guess what happens when a spell called \u201cDislike Floor\u201d meets \u201cWall is Floor?\u201d Well essentially it becomes \u201cDislike Wall\u201d and reorients their flight controls ninety degrees so instead of flying up, they are flying away from me.\n  \n\n  \nI smirk and end the spell on myself as I reach the roof. I should clarify, as of this point you don\u2019t know why anyone is chasing me, yes? Well, allow me to explain while I finish my journal entry. I was the first one to translate the arcane language in completion using a variety of arcane linguistics, mathematics, and code. \n  \n\n  \nBecause of this, I can actually work backward and create my own spells, instead of stumbling upon random ones by saying the right words accidentally. Those people chasing me, they control the arcane standard. They don\u2019t want my knowledge to get out because it makes them powerless. And yes, many mages are power-hungry, it's a natural byproduct of the occupation.\n  \n\n  \nLooks like they caught up to me again. I mumble a bunch of arcane gibberish which essentially comes out to \u201cSticky Floor\u201d as they land on the roof. It\u2019s a restraining spell, essentially. \n  \n\n  \nWhile they struggle to undo the spell, I cast \u201cObject Impregnation\u201d ah, yes, that probably sounded weird. So a lot of terms related to objects are biological. It\u2019s essentially an object duplication spell. My journal, now complete with the explanation of how spells work, begins duplicating, or, having babies, as it were. \n  \n\n  \nMy pursuers are now free and approaching me once more. I cast \u201cWrong Light\u201d which creates illusionary images of me in the wrong place to buy me time as I begin casting \u201cDifferent Floor\u201d on each of the journal clones, teleporting them to well, different floor.\n  \n\n  \nEventually, my pursuers find which one is the real me. I smile and turn to face them. It\u2019s too late, I\u2019ve already sent out all the journals. Soon all the world will know the truth. There\u2019s no use sticking around.

{"prompt": "Rinkth appears at the nearest teleport, a speck about ten tails out. Galloping in what appears to be spellbound paces, she's beside me quickly, squinting at my chair.\n\n\"Still haven't cracked it?\" she quips, then looks about the open plain, sizing up what she can deduce of the small mount at whose base we are. Sky's clear and visibility is deep. We're lucky.\n\n\"Nope,\" I look down at my frozen legs, \"the biomagic is strong, but I've found my ways.\" I point toward the end of the clearing, where trees line a dense forest. Rinkth follows my point and I can tell when she catches the cave entrance, not huge but not far and discernible through the thicket.\n\n\"My time is expensive, old friend,\" Rinkth says after a moment of calculating what's ahead, then whispers codes that trigger the dissembly of her suit, space-ready by the looks of it. Last we spoke, she was on imperial guard contract with the alchemists in Martian-controlled Luna. Maybe she was still working that. She pulls out some sort of puffer and asks, \"What are we doing here?\" Then she takes a drag.\n\n\"I need help getting to someone in that cave,\" I say, unbuckling a sash of crystals. \"This should cover about a month of your time, but I think we can do it in about four days. There's a wizard there. I've got questions for them, and I need you to escort me. And protect me.\" \n\n\"This the farthest you could teleport? And you want me to push you through this...

We doing this alone?\"\n\nI smile, relieved. Rinkth trusts me, and Rinkth is brave, but she knows that many crystals means mortal danger. \n\n\"I hired three Antarcticians, assassins from the Tropical Wars.

Figure we get close to it tonight and set camp to rest, I've got some REM dust to help.\"\n\nRinkth clicks her teeth and cracks her knuckles, then stretches and moves behind me, grabbing the bar across my wheelchair's back and pushing. \"Tell me about the wizard,\" she says as we head toward the forest, the uneven ground giving me a bumpy ride.\n\n\"I cracked the Codae,\" I say and we stop moving. I can sense hesitation Rinkth rarely allows to be seen, but she swallows and pushes on. I continue, \"the foundational spells, they're not what we thought. They're simpler. Smarter. Cleaner. They're... Basic. I sourced them to this area and eagled for weeks looking for heat signatures. It's all right in that cave. But the wizard,\" I pause to consider my wording, still working it out myself, \"I believe the wizard is a child. A child in mind, perhaps grown in body, but a child with such immense spiritual magic it could deconstruct and reconstruct without training, or even schooling.\"\n\nWe continue in silence for a beat, and Rinkth asks, \" I don't understand why you predict so much danger then. Unless\u2014\"\n\n\"Yes, I think the child is angry. And I think the child is behind the sun cooling, and\u2014\" \n\nRinkth clears her throat and announces, \"Say no more, I don't need to\u2014I don't want to know. I've heard enough, and the rest is details and blood.\"\n\nNow that Rinkth is fully on board, I go back to meditating, running myself through the military-grade spells I've been studying, as well as the psychologic persuasions I dug up from the ancient orators. \n\nI whistle and sing one of Rinkth's favorite tunes from our school days, \"...

A synonym is practically the same word, it's stupid-\n\n*The result of the report is stupid.

I was initially engaged by the story. However, the middle of the story lost me a bit. I wasn't entirely sure what was happening, and the story felt a bit disjointed. I think you could benefit from focusing on developing a clearer plot and more concrete characters.\n\nThe ending of the story redeemed it for me a bit. I thought the grandfather's use of magic to punish the man who harmed his granddaughter was creative and satisfying.

That famous celebrity will visit our city!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the TV. \"There's going to be a publicity event for the film you got us tickets to\"\n\nHis boyfriend smiled and nodded. \"That's right, I think that's because the film is based on a local legend. You know, the one about the cheerleader who ended up being a serial killer in the 80's?\"\n\nJames nodded. He definitely knew the story, he went to the same high school as that girl, so people talked about it almost every day.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure we could go together,\" James said. \"You're always talking about the movie, I know you'd like it.\"\n\nRyan grimaced.\n\n\"I'd love to, but I have a work trip that week, remember?\"\n\nJames deflated. \"Oh, yeah. I forgot...\"\n\n\"Hey, what about this.\" James looked up at the sound of his boyfriend's voice. \"I'll try to sneak out of that day's meetings and we can go to the event together. The other city isn't too far anyway, so I won't have to travel for too long.\" Ryan smiled. \n\nJames nodded enthusiastically. \n\n\"Sounds like a plan!\" \n\n----------------\n\nIt was a terrible plan. James has been in the queue for the event for hours and hasn't received a single text from Ryan. Did he forget? Was he able to cancel his meetings? What if his car crashed on the way here and James was a terrible boyfriend for being at a celebrity event instead of at his side?\n\nHis phone pinged with a message.\n\n&gt;*Where are you?*\n-\n\n&gt;*I'm near the door, we'll be able to get in as soon as they let us. U here yet?*\n\nJames sighed. He's been here for hours, since he wanted to get in early to get a good place for his boyfriend. \n\nHe felt really lonely in the middle of the crowd. Most of these people were probably dying to get a glimpse of the actors, while James was just there to spend time with his boyfriend. The people on the posters were unknown to him, and it doesn't help that the actors all look like generic famous people. You know the type: fair-skinned, conventionally attractive, symmetric faces, the whole deal. Although, one of the main actors kinda looked like his boyfriend. That would be fun to tease him about, maybe it was the hair? \n\nHe checked his messages.\n\n&gt;*Find the nearest service entrance to the left, gotta show you something*\n\nJames frowned.\n\n&gt;*I'll lose our place in the queue. We won't be able to get in if I leave, there's too many people.*\n-\n&gt;*Trust me on this one ;)*\n-\n&gt;*If we don't get in I'm going to be mad. I've been waiting for hours.*\n\nHe pocketed his phone and reluctantly got out of the queue. He felt a little awkward on his way there, all of the people going in and out of the door were obviously related to the event. Did Ryan sneak in? \n\nHe looked around, but he couldn't see his boyfriend. He quickly called him, not wanting to get in the way of the workers. \n\n\"*Hi babe!*\" the sound of his boyfriend's voice greeted him. He was definitely there, judging by the sounds of people that were coming through the phone. \n\n\"Ryan, it's me. Where are you and why did you make me go to the service entrance? I can't see you anywhere.\" \n\n\"*Wait, let me go get you.*\" Again, the sound of rustling and a few 'excuse me's could be heard. \"*Look at the door, babe.*\" \n\nJames looked up and saw his boyfriend waving at him from the other side of the door. Wide-eyed, he approached him and ended the call.\n\n\"What are you doing here? How did you get in?\" He asked while following him inside.\n\n\"I said I wanted to show you something\". Ryan answered nonchalantly, before taking his hand and guiding him through a door.\n\nThe room looked a lot like a dressing room. It was definitely a dressing room, so why did his boyfriend take him there?\n\n\"I know you're probably confused, so let me explain.\" Ryan said after closing and locking the door. \"I've kinda been lying to you. A little. By omission.\" He grimaced.\n\nJames smiled nervously, looking around. \"I'm a little worried now. Care to explain how you've been lying to me?\"\n\nHis boyfriend nodded.\n\n\"Well, I kind of didn't tell you because being with you was really comfortable, but this is the biggest project I've worked on yet and people are definitely going to start bothering us about me so...\" He took a deep breath. \"I'm an actor. In this film, specifically. Most of my work trips and my weird hours are from filming and other events. That's also why we always hand out at your apartment and why I like our dates to be in private places\"\n\nJames could only stare at him. That was not the worst thing that could have happened. But it was really unexpected and it was weird that he never noticed.\n\n\"Are you mad?\" Ryan asked, grimacing. \n\nJames blinked. \n\n\"it's... definitely something. I'm mostly confused as to why you didn't tell me before. Or how I didn't notice. Is this your movie then?\" \n\nRyan nodded. \n\n\"I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to treat me differently once you new. And, well, you didn't notice mostly because you're very face blind.\" He offered a weak smile. \"There was a poster of my on a billboard right in front of your appartment for weeks, one time.\"\n\n\"There was a what?\" James asked dumbfounded. \n\nHis boyfriend laughed. \n\n\"Yeah, we walked right past it when people were putting it up and I was mortified thinking you'd notice it's me and we'd break up but you only looked at it for a second and then said 'damn, he's hot' and kept walking.\" Ryan walked closer to him. \"You're not mad?\" \n\nJames shook his head. \n\n\"I kind of get it. I just wish you had told me sooner.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Dont worry about it.\" \n\nJames frowned a little, remembering something. \n\n\"I was actually going to tell you that one of the actors look like you. But it's you, right?\" \n\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" Ryan giggled.\n\n\"\"Well, uh. He's hot.\"\n\nThey both bursted into laughter. \n\n\"So, are you going to introduce me to your other, famous, coworkers?\" James asked, a small smile on his lips. \n\n\"Uh, actually you've met two of them. Twice.\" James covered his face, embarrassed. Ryan took his hands away from his face and kissed his forehead. \"Buy yeah, I'll reintroduce you to them and introduce you the rest.\"\n\n\"\n\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Starting with a compliment, I really enjoyed the short story and the plot line. The idea of the boyfriend being a famous actor and the protagonist not knowing was a really interesting twist. I also liked how the story was set up, with the exposition at the beginning and then the climax at the end.\n\nConstructive criticism wise, I would work on developing the characters a bit more. As it stands, the reader doesn't really know much about the protagonist or the boyfriend. What are their hobbies? What do they like to do for fun? What are their hopes and dreams? Answering these questions will help the reader connect with the characters more and make them more three-dimensional.\n\nEnding with another compliment, I thought the ending of the story was really well done. It wrapped up the plot nicely and left the reader with a feeling of satisfaction."}

{"prompt": "Their first date started out like an offensive joke: a murderer and a prosopagnostic walk into a bar. The bartender says, \"Hey miss, I've got some old dudes out back, wanna take a sip?\" The prosopagnostic woman just sighs, and motions for her date to leave, annoyed that the memory of her \"promotion\" had left her before it left the minds of the general public. Her date however, was frozen, eyes locked on the bartender. He responded, \"What's your problem miss? Now either buy a drink or leave before I make the decision for you.\" Trembling, she stood up; it was all happening too soon.\n\nThe television cast a dull glow over the small apartment; ramon and chill wasn't the ideal replacement for a date, but neither of them had enough cash for anywhere other than the bar. The local news station grunted out reports of random, uninteresting events as they talked, more background noise than anything else. They avoided the happenings at the bar; both thought it was them, since even murders make there way to small towns, but no one ever forgets a bribe. There was a wall between them, but even as the television broadcast the poor date's name through the air like it did five time a day, their eyes never unlocked. Normalcy was something to be valued, and it was the least she could do to give the murderer normalcy for a few hours before the police arrived.

I mean this was late at night, people. This was at like 11PM, it's almost midnight. I shouldn't have even been out, I am not going to lie, but it was the weekend and I was just trying to have some fun with my friends . So my friends and I are all having an awesome time floating around, chilling, and all of the sudden this ship full of people, let's call him, Gerald, (M) comes up to me, like barreling down at like 20 knotts. ((Honestly, it was probably more like 22 knotts or even 24 knotts.))\n\nAnyways, my friends all agree as we are watching this happen, that this is insane. It's 11PM , people should be sleeping, you should be going slower at night too (Isn't there like a law for that kind of thing?IDK)\n\nSo anyways, this big ship was all like \"MOVE OUT OF THE WAY!!\" as it comes barreling at me at some crazy speed. \ud83d\udca6 \n\nOKAY, so this is probably totally bad behavior on my part, like I said I was tired and had a long day at work. When the ship was coming at me, and all my friends were watching (sort of egging me on, not going to lie) , I just .... I just didn't move. \n\nHonestly it would have been no problem, but I don't know. It was in the moment, and there was all this yelling and screaming and dying, and I was too tired to think right.\n\nWas I too stubborn? Should I have been the bigger person?\n\nIf you are just standing there, and some guy tells you to move out of the way for *HIM* , is it so wrong to say \"Uh, No!\". Why does he have the right of way, and I don't? It just really hurt my feelings, that this guy comes up to me and tells me to move, and what- I just obey?\n\nWhy because he is a man and I am an Iceberg? \ud83d\udeabThat's discrimination in my mind!\ud83d\udeab\n\nSo long story short, all these people like froze to death in the water after Gerald went full speed ahead and bumped into me. I shoved him off of me, and I didn't know the guy only had like two hulls. If I had known he had two hulls, I would have been way more gentle, or even just moved.\n\nI think they said like 1,500 people died in the water, so honestly I was pretty bummed about it. You know, I could see all those little cute humans just drowning in the water there, but I am not CPR certified or any of my friends, so we just bounced and didn't look back.\ud83e\udd76\n\nI feel really bad guys.

{"prompt": "Am I the asshole for trying to redistribute wealth?\n\nIn America, we have so many rich people that hoard so much money, that if you earned 100 dollars a day since the day Jesus was born, you still wouldn't have as much money as Jeff Bezos.\n\nElon Musk bought Twitter for about 44-45 BILLION dollars. That amount, if given to every single American as per the US census bureau in 2022, would be about $135 dollars. For a purchase that could be argued was solely based out of either boredom, or to protect his fragile fragile ego. \n\nWe have mothers struggling to feed their children formula nationwide, where more and more states are rolling back abortion laws forcing more women to have children they don't want. This is all done to perpetuate the religious compound that exists within America: neglected children are a breeding ground for churches, making unwanted forced term pregnancies a valuable source of future income. You can't sustain religion if you're not having kids, and you can't make it out of poverty if you're forced to take care of some human you don't want and bestowed consciousness on without consent. \n\nWe have bridges collapsing and tarnished water in cities. We have people buying jets and multiple car garages while having the lower class rely on busses and metros to survive, and forced to never thrive.\n\nI'm done pretending this is all on accident, and that the majority of these poor people are lazy; IMO if you believe that you're more disconnected than I thought. \n\nWe need a massive revolutionary redistribution of the wealth of the 1% to be redistributed among all Americans so ALL can benefit.

{"prompt": "here the thought of a 2020 word generator THIS IS NOT MINE THIS IS A WORD GENERATOR CREDIT GO TO INFERKIT :  \n\" An AITA post from a supervillain desperate to be told they're doing the right thing.  \nVolcano  \nIn March, I wrote about the lack of diplomacy by the AITA and the Indian board in the past week, when they couldn't even wait for the Indonesia results to be out before they called the team for the tie. The ITA, who aren't happy that the ties, originally scheduled in December, have been brought forward by a month, has decided that they want India to host the tie, even though the Indian team wasn't selected, for reasons that the tournament president didn't fully understand in a Reddit AMA.  \nBut this is a perfectly normal and understandable stand for the ITF to take. What's not is that a tennis federation decide to change the rules of an international tournament at the last minute on the teams of their junior players, after they had started their respective seasons.  \nThe ITA, to their credit, have issued a public apology to the Indian Davis Cup team. AITA have set up a committee to look into the matter and, hopefully, to get the right outcome.  \nBut one outcome it isn't: No Davis Cup tie at home in 2019.  \nSo What's New  \nThe Indian men's hockey team is facing World Cup Qualification. If they fail to qualify for the World Cup, it is the first time India will miss a World Cup since 2002.   \nThe England women's hockey team have, of course, not lost a single match since the Hockey Women's World League Final last year. In 2018, England has been ruthless, winning the Asia Cup and winning the Commonwealth Games gold. As if that was not enough, they did it without ever having a single goal disallowed.  \nBut who is topping that list? No one, no one is. It is India. The men's team is sitting in a playoff spot in the Asia Cup and a semifinal spot in the Hockey World League Semifinal (qualification for next year's World Cup). The women's team has earned an automatic spot in the World Cup by finishing second in the HWL Final. What more would you like?  \nAnand Amritraj (left) and Ramesh Krishnan (right)  \nMarketing The Next Gen  \nVijay Amritraj was one of the main champions of bringing the Indian juniors to Pune for the Tata Open.  \nWith Vijay Amritraj as one of the main champions of the event, and with the support of the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), the India Open is now a bigger deal than it was before.  \nWith the WTA's under-14 girls and boys championships (funded by the World Group and the ITF) being held at the Pune Tennis Academy, the tournament has now been given a bigger visibility. The tournament has also helped to give some much-needed employment opportunities to the young players.  \nAt the net-work at the Tata Open, Amritraj also discussed a big change in tennis in India: the dearth of marketing and advertising, even as the sport gets more and more popular.  \nKrishnan and Amritraj talk  \n\"We have been very lucky with the advertising companies in India. It has been fantastic,\" Amritraj told ESPN. \"The whole trend of tennis is going back to the amateur days with marketing and visibility. We are struggling a little bit to find the right marketing message. We have the best players, we have a great game and we have a very huge fan base in the country. We need to package it in a way to get out the right message.\"  \nAmritraj said that it was important to market the sport well so that it doesn't get overrun by too many junior players. \"When there are 12 players in the ITF ranking who are all very good but do not get a chance to play top-100 players, they are not prepared for top-100 players. So we need to package it in the right way,\" he said.  \nAmritraj said the game was going through a process where players are getting younger and younger. He said that the growth of tennis in India was an important step for the sport. \"The whole sport is getting younger. It is exciting for us to see.\"  \nMeanwhile, Ramesh Krishnan was found speaking to Ashishkumar Singh on Facebook Live about the making of Bajirao Mastani. Singh is the marketing manager of Dharma Productions. He said he heard Krishnan comment on the promotion of Bajirao Mastani, and so he got in touch.

{"prompt": "A single grain of sugar, placed upon a leaf. That was enough to attract a butterfly to perch next to it. When that butterfly took off again, the flap of its wings was seen by a child. That child ran towards it, wanting to see a butterfly up close for the first time. They ran across the road, forgetting to look both ways. Driving on that road was a businesswoman, who had to slam her brakes to avoid hitting the child.\n\nThis caused her to be 2 seconds behind where she otherwise would've been. Far enough back to avoid getting crushed by a dying tree falling onto the road in front of her. That woman would go on to her work, and negotiate a deal between the company she worked for and another company, which would've fallen through without her.\n\nOne part of this deal was the creation of a new research and development division. One of the many people hired by this division was Mark M. White. He originally took it as a summer job, and it sparked a passion for tinkering and engineering within him. He started a hobby project of his own, an efficient electric motor. \n\nHis work was published in the local newspaper, which found itself in the hands of a talent scout for a government project. Mark was recruited to this project, a project to build a time machine. \n\nAfter several long years, sending electrons and protons seconds into the past, they finally had a working prototype. It could send an object the size of a grain of sand up to 10 years into the past. After some thought, a grain of sugar was chosen, as it had slightly less mass, and it would be easier to keep track of, since sugar is a more rare material than sand.\n\nThe machine powered up, the grain disappeared.

Weird Al, as we called it, was an algorithm designed to use predictive mutarotations of a model of a double helix extrapolated from the DNA of the Earth's first cell, obtained by iridium-radon de-aging via temporal wormholes, had finally been run. Its primary function was to be able to calculate the least number of moves required to make an event in the future change. Basically, it calculated the butterfly effect.\n\nWe decided to start small. Interpol had forwarded us a tip about a bank heist in France. We knew that it would happen 4 days from runtime. It was a tight schedule, but we needed a perfect field test. And this was it. \n\nA minute after we executed the painstakingly crafted program, the algorithm printed out a set of instructions onto the holographic screen. We all stared at it open-mouthed, and in pin-drop silence. Finally, after what seemed like years, Mark broke the silence. \"But this is nonsense!\" \n\nI agreed with him, but I still knew that we'd signed an agreement with Astley Industries to follow the instructions given in the letter. And so that was why I found myself in a Somalian restaurant in Texas. I looked at my watch. 13:05:07 GST. I positioned my hand next to the salt shaker. 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi, 3 Mississippi, nudge. It seemed to fall in slow motion. Right onto a rat that had decided to try to move under my table.\n\nUnderstandably, the poor animal panicked. It leaped onto the face of a waiter, who let out a string of cuss words that would have made a rapper convert to Catholicism, and begin a monastery in Southern Ecuador. The waiter, also understandably flung his tray of piping hot goat stew onto a customer who gave a shriek that would have had him a place at the Sydney Opera house, had he been at an audition. My work done, I quickly left. I had no time to lose.\n\nWe were using a drone-based tracking system to track the people my actions affected. As my flight took off, I found that all of them were still in Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\nI soaked in the sea breeze and sighed. I hadn't slept in twenty-five hours, and wouldn't sleep for atleast another thirteen. Mission rules stated it explicitly. I looked at my watch. 23:00:09 GST. One minute twelve seconds to go time. I turned around and saw several things. \n\nThe newspaper I'd been told to buy, The Economico Studelio was apparently popular, there was just one left in stock. And a businessman was power walking over to the newspaper stand, his eyes on it. Well either it or he wanted to ask the paper-boy on a date. In one fluid motion I formulated my plan and put into action. \n\nI sprinted forward, just like I had all those years ago in numerous track meets. I slipped off my jacket and flung it at the businessman, who'd reached the stall. Just as he opened his mouth, the jacket landed on him and his mocha-latte. I shoved him aside, and gave the paper-boy who'd turned his head a disarming smile. It was then that I noticed that I'd somehow shoved the poor businessman off the concrete platform and onto the steep sandy beach. He'd rolled right into the ocean and was spluttering in indignence. Poor sod. \n\n\"I'd like a copy of the Economico Studelio please,\" I asked.\n\nWithout a word he tossed it over and pointed at the price on the rack. I scanned the QR code and entered in the requisite amount. I glanced at my watch. Shit I thought and pressed the button. Right on time. Now to Paris.\n\nAs I boarded the flight, I noticed a familiar face. The businessman! His hair was full of sand. I'd switched my horn-rimmed glasses for Aviators though and slicked back my hair with an entire bottle of hair gel. My  brand new neon orange windcheater was more than enough to make sure he'd never recognize me.\n\nSoon we were in the bank. \"Any connections?\" I queried my newly arrived teammates. Marks replied, \"Apart from Sandy, nothing. But there is a Somalian in the gang. But no one from Texas has left there yet.\"\nI nodded. It was going to happer, or not happen any second now. \n\nMark nudged me. A handsome black woman in a suit entered the bank. She was the head of the gang. Codename the Pirate. As she stood in line, she was chatting animatedly on the phone. I moved near her, trying to pickup what she was saying. Then I smiled. \n\n\"A rat! A goddamn rat! And the waiter! Oh My God. If more of these videos are posted on Youtube, we Somalians will be seen as worse than Americans!\"\n\nSuddenly Sandy entered the bank. He barged in front of her and began shouting at the receptionist. \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY ACCOUNT WAS TERMINATED!\" She said something softly. \"NO I DID NOT READ IT IN THE NEWS. I FELL IN THE BLOODY OCEAN. AND EVEN THEN I PROBABLY WOULD ONLY HAVE BOUGHT THE GODDAMN PAPER TO CHECK OUT THE PAPER-BOY.\" \n\nThe Pirate, clearly angry said to the man, \"Sir, I was here first.\" The man clearly beyond reason now backhanded her across the face. Or rather he tried to. She ducked, and using her Brazilian juijitsu skills, she tossed him acriss her back, instinctively throwing her case to the side. The case hit the gold bannister with such force that the locks snapped open. Revealing the built in submachine gun. Within seven seconds, security guards were all over them.\n\nLater it was discovered, that the businessman had illegally parked behind the fake ambulance, trapping the rest of the gang inside, as only the Pirate had the front door keys. \n\nAs Sir Rickard surveyed our summary, he smiled. The CEO of Astley industries was pleased. He began to enter a new directive into Weird Al. \n\"STOP\" He frowned. He shook his head, switched off the mainframe and left the building.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The story is well-written and engaging, but there are a few areas that could be improved.

I tried talking, and it didn\u2019t work. Now I\u2019ll use force.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cEnough, Jali. Paul is right. We have tried to use violence and yet the problem remains. We would be foolish to jump into a fight without exhausting all our other options. So, mage. Would you be willing to speak with us?\u201d Lady Ellyia said, the elven leader keeping her gaze on the man, trying to read his blank face.\n\n \n\n\u201cI was always willing to speak to you. I haven\u2019t moved from this chair since you three got here. Forgive me if I mistook you running me out of your city all those centuries ago as a sign that you didn\u2019t wish to try the negotiation tactic any longer. To think you would send your guards after me when I was at my weakest. Did you tell the humans the truth about your one hundred years of war with them? That the magic blast that turned the battle in your favor was something you requested of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a young queen back then. I didn\u2019t see any other option for my people. But yes, I told them the truth. It seemed only fair that I should acknowledge my mistakes if we wanted peace. What\u2019s your excuse for going along with my orders? Surely, a legendary mage should have had more common sense?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m allowed, I would like to use the same excuse as you. I was young and enchanted by elven beauty. I believed you were right. I knew the awful things that humans could do and wanted peace. That peace you promised me.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou got that peace, eventually.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAfter you dragged the war out for another fifty years. It wasn\u2019t until the humans pushed back again that you screamed for peace. Had the humans never shown a backbone, you would have crushed them. I know it, you know it, and the poor man next to you knows it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIf you intend to make us doubt one another, you will need to try harder. War is a dirty thing and Ellyia is responsible for the death of a lot of my ancestors, but that is war. Had I been in her shoes, I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t have done the same. What I find hard to swallow is the fact that a human would kill his own kind in a war.\u201d Paul said, removing his hand from Jali\u2019s weapon.\n\n \n\n\u201cMy kind? That\u2019s funny. I see none of you as my kind. I\u2019m above anyone here. You could send armies after me and you would still lose. Each of you know that and yet you persist in agitating me. The aggressive dragon you hate has found a cave to lie in and yet you come and poke him. How many more pokes do you think it will take to get the reaction you want?\u201d\n\n \n\nThe three looked among themselves, watching as the mage stood up from the chair. He still wore the same robes as he had during the war, their once regal blue now tattered and dirt covered. He made his way over to a small pot of tea, still relying on fire to warm the pot rather than just using his own abilities. Once he had the tea, he set out four cups, pouring one for himself and then filling the others.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat do you really want? Is it just fear that has brought you here? Or do you think I will just roll over after all your attempts on my life? That I would simply just give up and go along with whatever you want to ensure my safety. I\u2019m not threatened, nor am I interested in changing my ways.\u201d Baldin said before raising his cup. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d \n\n\u201cLike I would drink anything you would give me. It\u2019s probably poisoned.\u201d Jali said.\n\n \n\n\u201cPoisoned? I wouldn\u2019t resort to such offhanded tricks. If I wanted you dead, I would have done it by now. I\u2019m doing this as a show of good faith. I may like none of you, but I, at the very least, respect that you came here without bringing an army.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThe army would come next if this went badly.\u201d Paul said.\n\n \n\n\u201cHeh, I still haven\u2019t gotten my answer. What do you really want?\u201d\n\n \n\nThe three didn\u2019t reach for the tea, each looking at another in the group, expecting them to make the first move. After a long silence, it fell on Lady Ellyia to speak for the group. She took the tea, giving the mixture a quick look over before taking a small sip of it. The mage looked at her expectingly, waiting for her reaction.\n\n \n\n\u201cIts nice.\u201d She finally said, before continuing. \u201cWe want assurance that you won\u2019t try to kill us all. The longer you gather your power, the more at risk we are of being unable to stop you. What we seek is a treaty.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAnd she speaks for you all?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cPersonally, I want your head displayed on my throne room wall, but a treaty will do.\u201d Jali added, leaning against her weapon. The conversation was already boring her. Humans and elves talked far too much for her liking.\n\n \n\n\u201cWe all want peace. Just tell us how to get it.\u201d Paul said, the human doing his best to dull Jali\u2019s comments. Hoping to slide them unnoticed past the mage.\n\n \n\n\u201cI see. Then let me make it clear.\u201d He sipped his tea, downing more of the warm mixture before setting the empty cup down. \u201cI won\u2019t be a problem as long as the world maintains order. If at some point, I sense your actions will bring about the death of the world, whether that be through war or some other destructive means. I will come out and kill everything before you can bring about that destruction. I\u2019ll give everyone a quick and peaceful death to ensure that no one suffers.\u201d\n\n \n\nSilence filled the room. The three leaders considering their next words. They had been given the assurance they wanted, but perhaps not in the way that they wanted to hear.\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, as long as we don\u2019t kill the world, you will stay in hiding? Sounds like a good deal to me.\u201d Jali said, turning to head for the door. The answer satisfying the orc.\n\n\u201cI will. Do you think you can keep the peace for that long? You have gotten close before. I don\u2019t just mean for a few centuries. This will span thousands of years. I\u2019ll always be waiting for that moment.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWe have created peace already. What\u2019s there to worry about? Look, all three of us were enemies at some point and now I\u2019m happily tagging along with the humans and elves. Well, not happily, but you get what I mean.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cMmm. May I ask why there are only three of you if there is peace? What about the dwarves? Or even something like a harpy. Sure, they may be minor voices compared to you three, but they are still voices.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThe dwarves come under the humans. Harpies and other monsters go under the leadership of Jali. We have thought these things through.\u201d Paul said.\n\n \n\n\u201cI see. How long do you think those minor voices will be happy being represented by you three? Eventually, they are going to want that sort of power too. I suggest you carefully think about that. If I were in your shoes, I would give them their own slice of this peace, or else you may be at risk of another tragedy.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou really think we are at risk of rebellion? So soon after we gathered peace? That is a lot to think about. Very well, I will think about what you have said.\u201d Lady Ellyia said, offering a bow before turning to the door, leaving with Jali.\n\n \n\nPaul went to leave, only to feel a hand grab his wrist. He swung around to see the mage staring at him. Their face pressed close to Paul\u2019s. \u201cYou humans are the real ones that they need to worry about. I predict you will be a handful in the future. Remember to tell your children about me. I would hate for our deal to be forgotten in the future.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI assure you; I won\u2019t let anyone forget.\u201d Paul tugged his hand free as the mage did not try to hold him any longer. Paul gave the man a quick nod before leaving to meet with the others. When the three had left, the mage returned to his seat, curious to see what the future would hold.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story sets up the conflict well and introduces the reader to the main characters and their motivations.

{"prompt": "\"Vraylar, Unrelenting Force, Fell Specter, Decimator of History\"  wow someone was going full titles outside my door, that hadn't happened in, hmm I think it's been about three centuries, hell I thought the world had forgotten me, clearly I didn't live up to that last one properly.  \n\"We of the united world alliance beseech and audience with you.\"\n\nI could always just ignore them, maybe they'd go away.  I could check on them with some form of magic but that'd take time.  Honestly it was hilarious no one ever figured out how weak I really was.  Just because you can decimate an army it doesn't really mean much if it takes days of preparation, or it wouldn't if they weren't all so damned afraid of me.  I honestly couldn't do many of the minor quick spells because they tended to be unreliable.\n\nI looked at the door to my peaceful little home out in the country.  I had specifically chosen to live way out here to avoid attention.  A momentary bit of nostalgia for when I lived in a fortress that intimidated everyone and kept them from even approaching.  Oh well nothing to be done about it now.  I stepped outside and was surprised, six people, a vampire hiding under an umbrella, two humans, no upon closer inspection a human and one of the fair folk in human guise, a shifter in his mid form black fur bristling claws jutting from his hands and only standing partially upright as if ready to drop to all fours at a moment, a merfolk in their human guise, gills and scales still apparent but at least capable of walking on land, and one of my own kind a pureblood mage his veins glowing with the mana that infused his very being.\n\nI gave a slight bow and a smile.  \"Now, what can I do for\" a pause as I tried to recall what they'd said.  \"the united world alliance.  I don't suppose you simply came to say hello, if you did it'd surely have been preferable to one of your party to wait until at least dusk.\"\n\nThe vampire stepped forward, his pale skin much more clearly visible, the umbrella twirling as he bared his fangs in what I assumed was a smile.  \"Vraylar, if I may call you that, you are correct this is not a simple meet and greet.\"\n\nI shrugged \"It is my name and titles stopped having meaning a few, was it decades ago that you united?\"\n\nThat got a raised eyebrow and a chuckle from the fae who shifted for a moment revealing her wings as she whispered \"You owe me.\"  \n\nI couldn't place which of them she was talking to but it wasn't particularly relevant.  The mage stepped forward glaring at me and begginning to shift his fingers subtlely.  Nope can't have that, I reached out and grabbed his hands in a death grip.  \n\n\"If you want these unbroken you will keep them still.\"  He glared at me but nodded his acquiesence.  I could see the others muscles were tensed, they still feared me, good that'd keep things a bit more civil.  I let go of his hands and looked around at the party assembled for a moment and stepped back from my doorway waving my hand towards the interior.\n\n\"Uncivilized of me to keep you all on my doorstep, I apologize please enter freely and know that the rules of hospitality are strictly adhered to in this household.\"  A smirk from me and most were hesitant to enter but the vampire seemed to be more then pleased to be invited in and out of the sun.  His unflinching entry apparently brought the rest of them tagging along.\n\nI led them through the foyer to the living room and asked if any would like anything.  I saw the merfolk glancing towards the kitchen and nodded before walking off into the kitchen, I decided I'd play it up a bit tonight as soon as I was out of sight I collected a glass of salt water, made a bloody mary with a couple drops of my blood for extra kick and flavor, some milk with just a touch of honey in it, a glass of wine that I'd been saving for a few well a while anyhow, I hadn't been able to peg the shifter so I poured a second glass of wine, and finally a vial of undiluted mana.  Satisfied that each guest would have something worthy of a dignitary I brought all out and set each in front of them.\n\nThe vampire and shifter immediately grinned at their glasses, the merfolk was already downing his.  The fae simply picked hers up and stirred it with a finger while the human and mage glared suspiciously.  As I finished serving I realized I had brought nothing out to drink myself.  Oh well, a good host prioritizes their guests.  I sat in my favorite chair looking at the motley crew assembled before me allowing them time to decide on their words.\n\nA sigh of contentment from the vampire.  \"A deliciously made drink, I'd swear you've entertained my kind before.  Apologies I realize now none of us have properly introduced ourselves.  I am Solemn Triad of the\" I grinned and finished his sentence \"of the court of vipers.\"  He looked a bit shocked then nodded \"Just so, I suppose you aren't as much a hermit as we thought if you know me.\"\n\nI shrugged then \"I keep apprised.\"  pointed at each in turn \"Mab of the Fae 3rd of her name.\" a slight gasp from the queen who was often thought eternal. \"Ferrithir of Tribe Noctis.\" The shifter simply gave a stoic nod.  \"Sal\" The human shrugged.  \"Apologies on my poor pronunciation, Qqurnr of the 4th Sea\"  The merfold gave a dismissive wave.  \"and unfortunately your sixth is actually unknown to me, perhaps his skills outstrip mine.\"\n\nThe mage nodded, he still hadn't touched the mana I'd offered.  \"I am Vraylar of the Arbitration Council.\"  I had to choke back a laugh at that, unfortunately it quickly became a coughing fit that doubled me over.  Normally I wouldn't comment on someones name but I couldn't help myself in this case.\n\n\"Ok is that your given or chosen name, I just have to know whether your parents were some random groupies or what the hell led to that?\"\n\n-Part One-\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " You have a lot of potential as a writer.

{"prompt": "\u201cSo. You want me, of all people, to give up magic? Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?\u201d\n\nThe one nicknamed The Immortal Mage was not amused. He had seen many silly things over his life- including the unification of all races. The man could not fathom why they thought that was a good idea, nor why they thought asking him to give up his livelihood was acceptable. He hasn\u2019t even cast a spell in a couple thousand years!\n\n\u201cNow- we know it\u2019s a tall order. But-\u201d The harpy tried to negotiate.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo buts! Tell me why.\u201d He growled, glaring at the 5 other members in the council. The mage could detect their armies outside. The harpy cowered. Pitiful.\n\n\u201cYou know why. Cursing entire races is cruel. We know you might be stuck in your old ways, mage, but we\u2019re prepared to fight.\u201d This time it was the wolverine that spoke. He remembers when their ancestors fell from the heavens. Now the Mage was wishing he had never done that because their species was annoying.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell this peace you\u2019ve conjured is ridiculous! It won\u2019t last very long- I\u2019m only speeding up the process!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe wolverine scowled at him, prepared to speak when the fae interjected. \u201cIt might last without your interference! Come on, man, accept the offer! We\u2019ll give you anything you desire!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I desire is the fall of kingdoms! A great tragedy for generations to come, to tell! I want a story.\u201d They were all at their breaking point, he could tell. As the Mage was standing, the siren commanded him to stay. Damn fish. The Naga slithered around the rock they were using as a table and coiled around him, speaking.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe can give you a story. Not a tragedy. Not a tragedy. The story of how we united. Yes. We can give you that. Yes we can.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Immortal Mage considered it, but when he tried to recall a story of peace, his mind came up blank. Only tragedies survived through history. He shook his head. The wolverine smirked.\n\n\u201cFine. Not even a Mage as legendary as you can handle the wrath of all 5 races fighting for their lives.\u201d The wolf started whistling- howling! What an ugly noise. Before the Mage could complain, though, he heard the stomping of a million feet and the beating of a thousand tiny wings. He sighed.\n\n\u201cHave it your way.\u201d He cast the curse. Contrary to what many believed his spells weren\u2019t grand nor were they big. He had no mana cap, sure, but he was not a flashy guy. In an instant, everyone stopped. The harpy gasped as its wings fell off and its talons melted into skin. The wolverine became nothing more than a beast in clothes, ripping into the fae beside it. The fae tried to fly away but found it couldn\u2019t, for it had no wings. The siren tried to sing. The siren suffocated. The naga wanted to shift into its snake form and slither away but found it was cut off, stuck between the two forms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd the Mage laughed, as kingdoms fell.

And that includes you.\u201d\n\nJect said nothing, his hand feeling the heat rise on his right cheek.\n\nTwins brothers with hair red as blood, the holders of the remaining two continents, stepped forward.\n\n\u201cI find seeking you both troublesome and necessary,\u201d the one bearing the crest of Paradise murmured, \u201cbut necessity trumps comfort.

However, there are a few awkward phrases and choppy sentences throughout the story. For example, \"The five head mages of the five continents stared at him with exactly the same expression: one of marked disgust.\" This sentence is a bit awkward and could be rewritten to flow better. In addition, you have some typos throughout the story, such as \"stuffed his fat finger into Ject's face, 'we lived with the results of your fatal mistake, so you owe us.'\"\n\nAside from these minor issues, you have a well-developed plot with interesting characters. The dialogue is believable and adds to the story. Overall, you have a great short story here."}
{"prompt": "My eyes widened as hair wildly grew out of Sabrina\u2019s arms. She let out a piercing howl that echoed in our living room. \n\n\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to be seen like this. It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d pleaded Sabrina.\n\nI reached out my hand and she howled again, her body transforming in the process. It was hard to believe that my girlfriend had transformed into the monster that now lay on the floor.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded as she began to roll around the carpet and get hair everywhere. It would be a pain to vacuum up the next day, but I was just more in shock of what had happened.\n\nI didn\u2019t have much time to think though. Sabrina scurried off quickly. I tried to chase after her, but she came running back with a tennis ball in her mouth.\n\n\u201cUh ok I guess this works,\u201d I said.\n\nI took the ball from her mouth and threw it across the room. The sounds of nails scratching up the hardwood made me cringe, but it was hard to stay mad when she ran back enthusiastically. I even smiled after throwing the ball a few times. Playing fetch like this reminded me of my old dog, Zeus, although I knew I would never tell Sabrina that. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d appreciate being compared to a dog, but in a way she was one just bigger and more human-like.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the fetch time was short lived. Sabrina ran over to a window and started barking at a squirrel in the yard. \n\n\u201cHey, Sabrina, stop!\u201d \n\nIt was no use. Sabrina simply darted over to another window when I tried to shoo her away from the first one. The barking continued. My ears were reminded of what it was like to own a dog. \n\nI would have to think of some sort of excuse to neighbors as to why there was a dog in my house, but at that moment I just hoped the music from my headphones would drown out the barking.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening paragraph does a great job of setting up the story and drawing the reader in. I particularly like the line \"I reached out my hand and she howled again, her body transforming in the process.\" This is a great example of showing instead of telling and it really helps set the scene.\n\nHowever, the second paragraph feels a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow better. For example, the sentence \"I even smiled after throwing the ball a few times.\" could be moved to the beginning of the paragraph so it flows better with the rest of the sentences.\n\nOverall, this is a great story with a unique premise. I really enjoyed reading it."}
{"prompt": "It is a lie that we are whole.\n\nWe are legion- all of us.  A thousand impulses, a million might-have-beens, all inhabiting a single body.\n\nWe're pretty good at ignoring it.  Pretending that there's one, and only one, who holds the controls and steers the ship.  In the moment, we can feel this way.\n\nIt's easier to notice the lie when we look back- rifle through our  memories and watch helplessly as the ship of self sails in ways that we, in the here and now, find abhorrent, incomprehensible, or 'cringe'.\n\nThe question of the ship of Theseus is not whether it is the same ship.  The question is if  it makes sense to think of it all as one thing, composed as it is of a thousand parts, swapping out here and there without great consequence.\n\nStill, it's a comforting lie.  The idea that we might be punishing an innocent person, who looks back at the crime with exactly the same horror as you...that's not helpful.  The criminal-in-the-moment may not think much of the other person who will come along later and inhabit their body, looking back in regret on their crimes, but we have precious few ways of influencing them after the fact *at all*.\n\nWe work with the tools we've got.\n\nBut it makes it all the more discomforting, to see yourself transformed, to see the lie so plainly exposed, the outer covering ripped straight down the middle.\n\nBefore, there was a man, in flesh and in form.  A man is his shape, and as a man he behaves.\n\nNow, there is a great beast, fangs and fur and muscle and madness.  And as a beast, it behaves.  Less fearsome than foolish, but a beast nonetheless.\n\nThe terrifying bit is that everything is the same inside, before and after.  There is no magic that can warp a mind, not truly.  There doesn't *need* to be.  Given a new form, new strength, new instincts, new chemicals crawling through the body and brain, the mind adjusts, swaps in a new aspect.\n\nIt's a terrible secret that all werewolves keep- all men know, in their minds, how to be wolves.\n\nIt's horrifying enough to look upon yourself like that, to look back at your memories and wish you had done anything else.  But there's more to the lie than what you tell to *yourself*.\n\nBecause we are social creatures.  Wolves are, as well.  We create a self, and show it to the world, and take great care to make it seem alive, seem complete, seem *whole*.\n\nWe build relationships, and trust, and intimacy, and love.  And live all the while in fear, that the veil will drop, that we will be seen as we truly are- many, ever-changing, filled with as many madmen as saints.\n\nMany a relationship has been torn asunder by a simple truth.  Ask those who have escaped the closet, who have come out as trans, how well even the closest relationships hold up in the face of an unexpected truth.\n\nSo werewolves hide.  They tell shallow lies to protect deeper ones.  They say that their loved ones would be in danger when they transform, that they might rip and maim and kill without any understanding.\n\nIn truth, a werewolf will only kill you when transformed if they would have killed you in their human form.  Wolves are social creatures, and would no more turn on their pack than we would.  The added strength and sharp claws make no difference whatever, any more than a beloved uncle would tear you apart simply because he started going to the gym.\n\nNo, werewolves hide because they are the same inside as they ever were.  It's simply a different portion of them brought to the forefront- the circumstances have changed, and so the *person* seems to change.  But they know their family, their loved ones, their friends.  They're still themselves, just with a new body and a new urge to howl and bark and piss on things.\n\nThey hide, and keep their secret.  Far, far better to be thought a monster than to be known for what you truly are.\n\nHuman.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening paragraph of your story is very strong. You immediately introduce the reader to the main idea of the story, that we are all composed of many parts. You also raise the question of whether it is helpful to think of ourselves as one thing. This is an interesting and thought-provoking opening that will make readers want to continue reading to see how you develop these ideas.\n\nYou develop your ideas well in the second paragraph. You explain how we usually ignore the fact that we are composed of many parts, and how this can be problematic when we look back on our memories and see ourselves behaving in ways that we would not approve of now. This is a very relatable experience that will resonate with many readers.\n\nYou continue to explore the implications of this idea in the third paragraph. You raise the question of whether it is helpful to think of ourselves as one thing, and explain how this can be a Comforting lie. You also introduce the idea of werewolves as an example of how a person can be transformed into something different. This is a clever way to explore the idea of transformation and its effect on our sense of self.\n\nThe fourth paragraph is also well-written. You explain how a werewolf's mind is still the same, even after they have transformed into a different form. You also raise the question of how relationships can be affected by this transformation. This is an interesting and unique perspective on the werewolf myth.\n\nThe fifth paragraph is well-written and provides a conclusion to the story. You explain how werewolves hide their true nature from the world, and how this can be a difficult secret to keep. You also provide a final thought on the idea of transformation and its effect on our sense of self. This is a thought-provoking ending that will leave readers thinking about the ideas you have explored in the story."}
{"prompt": "A hot summer night.\n\nThe air is heavy with the scent of an oncoming storm, the moon is locked behind dark, thick clouds, and the lone woman walks the street of a remote village. \n\nShe appears under the light of the lampposts and disappears into the darkness in between them, heading for a dirt path. She wears a jean and a red hoodie.\n\nDirt crunches under her boots, the last house disappears behind her. During the day this is just a meadow bordering a fenced field meant for the cows to lazy around and grow fat. In the night, the mind plays tricks with the shadows, shapes take form for a second before vanishing, reality and fantasy merge together. \n\nTrees border the path, the leaves rustle gently under the wind as she walks upwards. Atop the hill, a much-needed fresh breeze plays through her hair and invigorates a horde of insects hidden in the grass. Suddenly, the relative emptiness is filled with the chatter of critters, and a lull in the clouds shows a single star.\n\nShe sits there, atop the hill, back against a lonely oak tree, gazing at the village lights below. Beyond the village, nothing but the calm dark. \n\nClaire has been walking this path since childhood to soothe her mind, it worked just as well in adulthood. She never got over the sudden dread she could feel when her imagination made the shadows come to life, brought her head to turn and wonder if, just for once, there wasn't indeed something right there in front of her. A childish fear she was delighted to have kept into adulthood.\n\nSeclusion, darkness, peace, a sanctuary.\n\n\"Risky night to be alone for a girl, is it not?\"\n\nClaire jolts upright. \n\nNot every shape at night is a trick from the mind.\n\nShe hadn't heard the man coming, doesn't recognize the voice. She can only make out his shape, a tall, slender person with large hands and a curiously high-pitched voice.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Someone who walks in the night, just like you.\"\n\nHe isn't from the village, and few would dare walk these parts without a light, he has none. He takes a step forward, Claire takes a step back.\n\n\"Don't approach me.\"\n\n\"Isn't it why you're here?\" she can hear his wicked smile as he speaks, \"to meet the big bad wolf, to play the fierce girl when you're dying for the beast to come out for you?\"\n\nA light drizzle comes down, Claire hears the envy, the aggression, the wolfish savagery in the words. Whatever the man is, he's dangerous, and she should have been more careful. \n\n\"Fuck off.\"\n\n\"Won't happen.\"\n\nHis joy pierces through in his words, he's delighted to have found a lone girl lost at night, far from everything, for his own amusement, for whatever horrors this meant for Claire.\n\nIt started to pour. Claire pulled up her red hood, she wouldn't go down without a fight. \n\n\"Fierce,\" she hears him licking his lips as he speaks, \"I like that.\"\n\nJust as he's about to advance, the clouds open and the full moon shines through, a ghostly light illuminating the gaunt, grinning man and a soaked Claire with her fists closed. The instant stretches wide, droplets fall from the leaves of the oak tree over Claire.\n\n\"Last warning,\" she whispers, just loud enough to be heard over the rain.\n\n\"Amuse me, get wild,\"\n\nClaire can see the stiffness in his pants.\n\n\"You asked for it. Fifi, come and say hi.\"\n\n*Thump*, it is barely audible, the sound of a heavy being taking great care to not make too much noise. \n\nClaire didn't like her night outings to be cadenced by Fifi's loud steps, it scared the owls and muted the insects. The latter still happened, they could feel when Fifi was near and weren't sure if they could sing.\n\nAll the fun is drained from the man's face as he slowly turns around.\n\nFifi stands taller than the madman, despite walking on his fours. A stocky, bulky mockery of a wolf, with every single muscle bulging wide across his frame, steely limbs to spring over wide distances, teeth glistening in the dark, eyes sparkling with sheer savagery. \n\n\"Go and get him, boy.\"\n\nNot every shadow at night is a trick of the mind.\n\nFifi certainly isn't, and his teeth sinking into the tender flesh of a fragile neck are ample proof of it, the realest experience tonight for the poor man, and his last too.\n\nIt's over in an instant, the neck cracks like a twig under the titanic maw, and Fifi is having a midnight snack while Claire pats his head.\n\n\"It's getting dangerous to walk out there at night.\"\n\nFifi grunts.\n\nAnyway, back to the scheduled program of the night.\n\nClaire sits back at her tree, looking at the night over the land, while Fifi chomps his appetite away behind her. The rain is a needed refreshment after the hot day.\n\nIn a minute, Fifi has ended his meal and comes to lay next to Claire.\n\nA minute later, and the insects starts to sing again.\n\nTonight is a good night.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of this story is very strong, setting the scene and mood perfectly. I love the use of sensory details to make the reader feel like they are there in the village with Claire. The only suggestion I would make is to be careful with your use of adjectives. In general, good writing uses strong verbs rather than adjectives to describe actions and objects. For example, \"The air is heavy with the scent of an oncoming storm\" could be rewritten as \"The air hangs thick with the scent of an oncoming storm.\" Just be careful not to overdo it with the adjectives.\n\nThe second paragraph is also well written, providing more details about Claire and the setting. I love the line \"In the night, the mind plays tricks with the shadows, shapes take form for a second before vanishing, reality and fantasy merge together.\" This is a great example of showing rather than telling the reader what is going on.\n\nThe third paragraph is where I start to have some concerns. The sentence \"Trees border the path, the leaves rustle gently under the wind as she walks upwards\" is a great example of using strong verbs to describe the action. However, the following sentence \"Atop the hill, a much-needed fresh breeze plays through her hair and invigorates a horde of insects hidden in the grass\" feels a bit overwritten. I would suggest cutting out the adjectives \"much-needed\" and \"fresh\" to simplify the sentence.\n\nThe fourth paragraph is well written, providing more details about the setting and Claire's thoughts.\n\nThe fifth paragraph is where the story starts to lose me. The dialogue between Claire and the man feels stilted and unnatural. I would suggest rewriting this dialogue to make it sound more natural. Additionally, the sentence \"She didn't like her night outings to be cadenced by Fifi's loud steps, it scared the owls and muted the insects\" feels a bit choppy and could be rewritten to flow better.\n\nThe sixth paragraph is well written, providing more details about the setting and Fifi.\n\nThe seventh paragraph is where the story really starts to lose me. The dialogue between Claire and the man feels stilted and unnatural. Additionally, the sentence \"Fifi certainly isn't, and his teeth sinking into the tender flesh of a fragile neck are ample proof of it, the realest experience tonight for the poor man, and his last too\" is overly graphic and disturbing. I would suggest cutting this sentence out or toning it down.\n\nOverall, this story has a lot of potential but needs some work in terms of dialogue and sentence structure. I would suggest reading over your story again and making sure that the dialogue sounds natural and that your sentences are not overly complicated. Additionally, be careful with your use of adjectives. Good writing uses strong verbs to describe actions and objects."}
{"prompt": "\"I just want the screaming to stop,\" whimpered Agares. Bones shifted under his feet as he hiked along the path to the clearing which had been his home for millennia. He clutched the hood of his cloak, pulling it tight against his ears. \"Just... Stop... Please...\"\n\nThe screams did not stop. Neither did the moans, the sobs or the howls. The cacophony of mortal agony persisted. Agares shut his eyes against the sight of viscera along the path, pulling his hood down further. He stumbled and fell to his knees, soaking the hem of his ancient robe in blood. His tears left clean tracks in the blood spatter on his care worn face.\n\nAgares could remember a time, distant but clear, when his home had been free of freshly flayed bodies. It had been beautiful once, held such by Agares' will. A tiny cottage. A meadow dusted with wildflowers. Fresh spring water from the brook. And best of all, no smiting. That was why he had left the light, had chosen to fall. He couldn't abide all the goddamn smiting.\n\nThings had been great for quite a while. Before the mortals. Before the punishment. The first of them had arrived suddenly one day, in a brilliant flash of light, with a note pinned to her back. \"If you're not gonna smite for me, you're going to play host. \\~ G\" Agares was confused but thought it might be nice to have some company. He thought wrong.\n\nThe mortals, it seemed, were a Trojan Horse of sorts. They brought with them something the endless fields of Hell were never designed to accommodate. The mortals came with context. They came with perception. They came with Linear Time.\n\nA millennia passed before the troubles started. Agares alerted Lucifer and the council but naught could be done. Hell's ethereal nature began to crystalize under the weight of observation by so many mortals. It's borders became static, it's features predictable. Hell's guests became too numerous. Their minds began to break under the sheer weight of time. It wasn't long until they began tearing each other apart. The violence grew until it was all encompassing.\n\nAfter a while, a trend began to emerge. New arrivals had the strangest stories. Stories of a hell run by Fallen who torture mortals forever for fun. They even knew some of the Fallen's names. The story was all the rage on earth it seemed. The injustice of it drove Agares slightly insane. His ex-boss was pushing this story, he just knew it. He had to find a way out. Had to get away. He would break open the very gates themselves if he had to.\n\nAgares stopped in his tracks as a brilliant flash of light illuminated the sky and several newcomers crouched frightened on a pile of skulls. The mortals spotted him, their faces turning white at the sight of his haggard face, long black robe, all soaked in blood. \"Oh God, oh God,\" one said. \"Is this Hell? Are we in fucking HELL?\"\n\nAgares took a steadying breath and shook the blood from his hands. An idea was forming in his mind, the first inkling of hope since he had gone mad. He needed to get out. They needed to avoid insanity and mindless slaughter. He squared his shoulders and, in a commanding voice, said, \"No. This is not Hell. Hell is no more.\"\n\nThey stared at him in confusion. One spoke up. \"Purgatory then? We're damned aren't we?\"\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Agares shook his head. \"You are not the damned. The damned have no hope.\"\n\n\"What hope do we have?\" the same man asked. \"What happened here?\"\n\nAgares stood a little straighter. \"Injustice happened here. And I hope you can help me fix it.\"\n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nI'm too tired to keep going.\n\nEdit: oh damn, so many kind words and just noticed the award, thanks kind strangers!\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could be improved. First, your sentences are often choppy and could be combined to be more fluid.

For example, instead of saying \"He stumbled and fell to his knees, soaking the hem of his ancient robe in blood.\" you could say \"He stumbled over a body, falling to his knees and soaking the hem of his ancient robe in blood.\"\n\nThird, your story has a lot of exposition and backstory, which is fine, but it sometimes interrupts the flow of the story.

At least on earth you got some good people that kinda balance it out so it\u2019s mostly okay, but here it\u2019s nothing but assholes and douchebags for as far as the eye can see, with a few okay people mixed in who just got abortions or slit their wrists like you\u201d \n\nAt her remark I instinctively sink my arms deep into my pockets, out of shame as if it had any use now. \n\n\u201cYou seem like a good kid, so I think you understand what it\u2019s like to be trapped in a place where you don\u2019t really belong.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I get what you mean.\u201c \n\n\u201dSo back to the matter at hand, you\u2019re going to need to fill out form 26-B before I can submit the application for a new license.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell do you have one here or can you print out one for me so I can fill it out?\u201d \u201cNo. You\u2019re going to have to walk over to that table over there and grab one and then grab a new queue number for yourself.\u201d She says, pointing to the table on the other side of the room. \n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re not serious, are you?\u201d I ask, confounded by the stupidity of how I need to wait another hour because I can\u2019t just walk over and grab a form and walk back to the counter. \n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s company policy to take a new customer as soon as the previous one gets up. Sorry, I don\u2019t make the rules, I just work here.\u201d \n\n\u201cFor the love of God\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t love you sir, that\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The dialogue in this piece is well done and natural sounding. I like the way the conversation between the two women is used to contrast with the protagonist's internal monologue. However, there are a few clunky phrases, such as \"going postal\" and \"Uber-hell\" which jar the reader out of the immersion in the story.\n\nThe description of the DMV is well done and vividly conveys the protagonist's feelings of frustration and anger. However, the description of the fallen angel is a bit heavy-handed and could be toned down.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written piece with engaging dialogue and vivid description."}

Is this Hell? It looks like an endless apartment complex. Y'know, the ones that span out for miles? The weird part is that ALL of the doors are unlocked...every single one. Then there's the people just walking into them, with no life whatsoever in their actions or eyes. Then the screaming, crying, the \"Please stop! I promise I won't do it again!\" \"No, my actions were right!\" \"Help!\" \"I'm Sorry!\". I passed by one and there was a \"Whip me HARDER!\". \n\n\"Yup. This is hell...and a BDSM lover's dream it seems.\" Then there was the person sitting in the corner. Looked quite sad, yes. So, I sat down next to him.\n\n\"Strange. A human who doesn't go off to get tortured.\" He began, confused as to why I didn't join the rest.\n\n\"I see no point. I committed my share of sins, yes but no need to be reminded of it for eternity.\" Which was my honest belief, thanks to a Preacher at a church I went to during my youth. \n\n\"For a human, your beliefs are rather odd. They don't align with what Father believes.\"\n\n\"Thanks? But then again, I don't regret my death. Kinda hard to do so when your city is missiled by some myopic asshole with the world's smallest handicap and you're at fallout zone. I highly doubt there's anything of me to even bury.\" Yup. I died due to some foppish prick (did he have orange hair? I don't remember) that decided to shoot a missile at a city. Though he could get away with it too. Ha hah, **NOPE**.\n\n\"You got any earplugs?\" I asked my new friend, who looked at me confused. \"I wanna take a walk but don't wanna hear any of this.\"\n\n\"Let me introduce you to some of my brothers and sisters.

Well, I guess making friends with the Fallen populace would qualify as an adventure.... right?\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very strong, you immediately pull the reader in with the conversation between the Reporter and Lucifer. I like the way you use Lucifer's dialogue to set the scene and establish the tone of the story. The description of Hell is also well done, it is both creepy and fascinating.\n\nHowever, the middle of the story feels a bit rushed and unfinished. The dialogue between the Reporter and the man in the corner feels stiff and unnatural.

Tell me, you honestly think that a man, any man, could survive the Tomorrow?\u201d The helmsman frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The captain straightened his belt. \u201cThey just want to put fears to rest back home, show that ghost stories don\u2019t hold power over the Blues. And we\u2019ll be the ones to prove it as fact.\u201d With the helmsman's fears addressed, he turned to watch as men busied themselves, never staring out past the stern, to the wall that watched.

Men began to shout, relaying orders as they pulled into the station, a well of shell-rock that stretched out, the mouth of a worm extending down, down into the water. He almost hoped that the Sphere was too big, but whatever horror had built this place had ensured that would not be the case. As the ship rested alongside it, he peered into the water resting inside.\n\nIt was pure, pitch black. One would assume it more akin to oil or tar as the lights of the night sky seemed to be doused by its stare. An alien, desolate black in the lush swamp. One of the prow-lights was shone down into it. He swore he saw something, a trick of his eyes. He swallowed. \u201cNot too late captain. No one\u2019s watching us.\u201d The helmsman, now without need of his post, stood nearby. The implication to abandon duty, in any other scenario, would have prompted roaring from the captain.\n\nBut the Well was so deep, so strange a thing that it captured his attention fully. \u201cHow far down\u2019s it go?\u201d Asked someone. \u201cThey say it goes down and away. From everything.\u201d\n\n*\u201cOr so they thought, Or so they thought,\"*\n\nWithout lifting his eyes, the captain motioned. \u201cMake ready men. We drop her down, wait, then pull it up. Three bells, just like the song.\u201d The sailors nodded, their loyalty overcoming their fear. The swamp seemed silent now, the frogs and insects stilled, watching the procession unfold. The Bathysphere was raised, the crane moving to hang her over the well, the brass of the compartment gleaming in the prow-light.\n\nThe heavy cord lowered, dipping the bobber into the water. It began to sink, the crisp white of the ship\u2019s light showing it sparkle as it went deeper. Deeper. Deeper. Until it too sank into that alien dark, without a trace beside the line holding it. The creak of the ship moaned as it went down. More and more coil dropping, until-\n\n*\u201cHis fate amended by his lost love, who\u2019d do anything to bring him back above,\u201d*\n\n\u201cCaptain! We\u2019re out of slack.\u201d Came the cry. He nodded.

The captain\u2019s collar felt sweaty. Was it the heat of the swampy air? \u201cSteady men. Steady.\u201d He called out.\n\nIt was well hard to see anything now. But the frogs returned then, their bellows and choruses loud and strong over the mud and silt. The noise brought comfort. It brought rationality back to him. No man could live for half a millennia, surely not. And especially not here. This was not a place men could survive.

Change history, and be at the head. Having a funny mustache or being short helps too.\n\nI took the easy way.\n\nThey locked up my corpse and left it to rot. As for me, I have just sat here waiting.

{"prompt": "He looked like a skeleton.\n\nHis hair were only wisps of smoke. His skin was greyed and wrinkled, sagging under its own weight. His arms looked like thin twigs held together by only the vestiges of muscle that could still remain.\n\nBut he was alive.\n\nAlmost 400 years since he was sentenced for one of the most gruesome mass murders in recorded history.\n\n\"How the hell is he even still alive?\" the guards asked, almost once a day. His body still accepted the food, though he ate very little. One of the guards swore you could see the food after he swallowed it. No one else had the stomach to watch.\n\nI was told that one of my maternal ancestors had actually witnessed his crimes. That she had hidden and cried as silently as she could when the blood began to seep into her hiding spot. He gave himself up willingly, that was how it was told, but many neglect to say he had snapped the neck of the person who first approached him.\n\nAbout 150 years into his sentence, people had long since recognized something was wrong. Lawyers, desperate to make a name for themselves, argued he'd served his time. That he was no longer a threat to mankind in his state. He had loudly announced that he would serve his full term. 400 years. The stenographer ended the transcript with only two words, unwilling to be in the room anymore than that. Oddly enough, they weren't even words spoken aloud.\n\n\"He smiled.\"\n\nLooking at him now, I can only imagine what they would have seen.\n\n250 years into his sentence, inmates were attempting to kill him.

Had seen him make an attempt at talking them away. Had seen them strike the first blow. And watched as he crushed their throats.\n\nIn the trial afterwards, he was acquitted due to overwhelming witness testimony. His sentence remained. The guards still moved him into solitary, to discourage any other attempts. He didn't seem to mind.\n\n350 years into his sentence, I had needed to find a job. I'd moved from Australia to find better work in Europe. I'd sold my parents' house after they passed to fund the entire trip. I wanted to get back to my roots. Turns out, my roots didn't want anything to do with me.\n\nI got a job at the prison, pretty sure the local rumors of a monster was just that, a rumor.

{"prompt": "\u201cIt seems like your sentence is almost up Logan,\u201d said Brady.\n\n\u201cWould you look at that, replied Logan, I guess it is.\u201c\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do when you get out?\u201d asked Brady.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do is to put all my meditation practice into effect. I am going to talk to people nice. I am going to  treat people right. I do not ever want to return to this pit. And then I am going to carve my teeth into the meatiest juiciest cheeseburger I can find.\u201d\n\nThe two cellmates filled the empty room with laughter from the heart. Although Brady had only known Logan for a few months they had become dependent on one another\u2019s talents and skills. Brady was a tattoo artist on the outside and a pretty darn good one. Some of his work made it to the best known tattoo magazines in world. He took pride in his work and remained skillful in his craft. Logan was an engineer and could make a rocketship from the spare parts of a beat up Volkswagen Beetle. They never took the time to know each other\u2019s personal history. All they knew was that one could paint and the other could make tools to paint with. They got along fine for the most part.\n\nYo Logan, asked Brady, I know we agreed to not ask each other stupid questions but it would make my remaining time here more or less bearable if I knew how a guy like you wound up in a place like this.\u201d\n\nThe truth is Brady, replied Logan, I fell victim to a game I did not understand the rules to. I played at high stakes and lost.\n\n\u201dDont give me that crap, protested Brady, who was the one who had your back when the Mexicans wanted your head for ruining the drug trade with the blacks. If it wasn\u2019t for me you would be in a wheelchair or worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about this, offered Logan, tatoo that drawing of Marilyn Monroe hanging from your bunk and ill tell you the whole story.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood one Logan, replied Brady, me and Monroe are staying together through thick and thin. But I can tattoo my latest drawing. I stayed up all night sketching this. And you dont want to know how long it took me to think of the concept.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal, concurred Logan, so what do you want to know?\n\n\u201cHow did you end up in a place like?\u201d this responded Brady.\n\n\u201dLong story short I murdered the man my wife was cheating on me with, concluded Logan. At first everyone believed it was a love crime so i got a minimum sentence. Upon my release i murdered the first guy who looked at me the wrong way. That was my second strike. Finally, I did my parole officer and that was strike three. If the autopsy didn\u2019t reveal that he had enough drugs in his system to support a small party i would have probably gotten the death sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow Logan, replied Brady, way to lay it on gently. Also remind me not to get into any staring contest with you .\n\nOne waited for the other to laugh before the release of the lightness within his being but eventually both were engulfed in merry laughter.  They both drank and shared their commissary with one another. Brady took care not to drink too much because he valued his reputation as an artist too much to have anything he tattooed be considered subpar. Logan made sure to drink enough to make the pain as bearable as possible. He could build pretty much anything given the time and resources but he knew that the ink machine he created out of cd player parts was going to sting considerably compared to the tatoo guns from the shops.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you want this tattoo, asked Brady, it wont hurt me none if you decide you are better off without it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFire up the gun, replied Logan, and I will pretend you didn\u2019t break one of the rules that has kept us off each other\u2019s throats.\u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that a guy like you used to be a cold blooded killer admitted Brady, if i had to describe my experience with you from the time we spent locked up together I would say it was nothing less than spiritual. The sketch I drew was partly based on some of the teachings of the Tao but I would have never even heard of them if it were not for your sleep talking. I might have saved you from the brown and proud but you saved me too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that shot of hooch got to your head Brady, answered Logan. If I am not mistaken I  have yet to ball up my fist or even pick up a weapon for that matter so how is that I saved you from anyone.\u201c\n\n\u201cYou saved me from myself, answered Brady.\n\n\u201cKeep that gun running Brady, said Logan, I think you might be drunk enough to let it turn off and sober enough to try to turn it back on. I am many things but a savior? Say how long did you let that stuff ferment for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot long enough, replied Brady.\n\nThey both shared a laugh worth its weight in gold. Logan enjoyed the rest of the night sipping the hooch they had prepared for moments like these. Brady only drunk enough to keep him focused on his craft. The rest of the night was comprised of Brady tattooing and Logan Enjoying the fermented drink. It was not long before morning came. Both were exhausted from staying up through the night but were ready for a new day.\n\n\u201cThere all finished, said Brady, Whaddya think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI might kill someone else in case i want to get another tattoo, replied Logan, is what i think.\u201d\n\nThey both laughed and if it wasn\u2019t for the announcement coming from the speakers located in every other cell they would have continued laughing until tears sprouted from their eyes.\n\n\u201cOpen cell four, hollered a deputy, Ramirez and Holvic step out of your cells with your hands where i can see them.\u201d The warden has a special job for you two.

I blinked in agreement to his prompt. \"We COULD make a few modifications of our own.\"\n\nI could almost feel the next words before they were spoken. \"What could go wrong?\" I turned around and started slithering away. \"No, that wouldn't be of any use. It'd waste time.\" I said.\n\nI could feel Murphy loudly clomping after me as fast as he could. \"You don't even know what I'm saying. It could end up being useful. Might even get us recognized and being part of the standard ship design.\"\n\nMy body froze. To have your personal modifications deemed so useful as to be standardized.........\nNo, the pamphlet is useful in that it prevents time waste and damage control.\nMurphy grabbed the pamphlet from under my arm and held it out. \"Just imagine a manual... with your name... right there.\" And tapped the author's name with his dull claw. \n\nIf the modifications were successful, I could write manuals. Not just pamphlets. Manuals.

I like the use of dialogue to establish this conflict. However, there are a few places where the dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. For example, the line \"I mean people still name their kids Murphy. And those kids could be assholes no one wants to talk to.\" feels like something that would be better said in thought or narration, rather than dialogue.\n\nThe second half of the story is very well done. I love the escalation of the conflict, and the way that it leads to the climax of the story. The ending is also very satisfying.\n\nOverall, this is a strong story with some great character development.

{"prompt": "Contrary to popular belief, not all demons are hell bent on spreading pain and suffering. Some lesser demons don't fancy it all even. Hell, it's a little, different from the surface world. You have your power tripping middle management except you can't just quit your job down here. No, it's a long exhausting process when you factor in eternity. You see time works differently, so much so that it's pretty much non-existent. But goddammit is the boredom as real as it can be. They use that shit against you in a fashion you quite literally cannot fathom. Needless to say, many demons don't have a choice but to meet their quota of what you probably know as possessions. I've watched just about every possession movie you humans have put out, huge fan. While their are some that get fairly close, none of them correctly depict how the possessions progress from infection to death and/or extraction. \n\nI can almost guarantee you've come acrossed someone possessed by one of these types of demons or you yourself were being controlled by one. Think back, most of you would have experienced this as a kid. Remember when your brother or sister, maybe even a cousin or a friend, randomly decided to steal something? For no particular reason at all, they just felt like it. Never had they stolen something before. That was a lessor. Just trying to fill their quota as easy and quickly as possible. \n\nLike in the films, children are some of the easiest hosts to overcome. Except it's not because they are weak. Not at all, infact it's the opposite. Unbeknownst to human kind the spirit of a child is usually impossibly fortified. That's their downside. Their spirit knows this and it's too trusting because it feels itself impenetrable. That's how we get in. We show a friendly face and the doorknob turns. Drinking between friends also provides a relatively easy crack to slip through. We get those idiots to do dumbshit all the time. \"Hey bro, hold my beer. I'm gunna ram this golf cart into that tree.\" These lessors figured they could fill their quota without causing too much damage. They figured what could go wrong, you know? Middle management really never cared because quotas were being filled and it was less of a headache to just leave it be. It was good. \n\nI'm running out of time here, I'll start getting to the point. A couple of your centuries ago, we got this newbie. Top of their class in our most prestigious demon academy. All we've heard since they arrived is how naturally talented they are and how they could rival the big man himself with some gidden ace up his sleeve. Straight up brown nosing son of a bitch I tell you. He caught on to the lessors' scheme and turned it against them. Against us. There are far worse fates than death. Some worse than spending an eternity in hell even. To avoid the unthinkable, some of us started doing the unthinkable.\n\nYou see, some of you, are not who you think you are. We found a way to intertwine our being, with that of a humans. Not a mear possession but a complete take over. We gain all their memories, their tastes although sometimes they don't always stick quite right and you... we, remember something differently or suddenly don't like the taste of something previously savored. The downside is we lose ourselves. We do not keep our memories. We keep almost nothing of our former selves.\nYou have to realize that your friend, Murphy, isn't actually your friend. You don't remember anything about them before they asked you, \"What could go wrong?\" Or \"Hold my beer.\" Murphy caught on to us again and he is continuing what he started. He wants to infect all of us to build his army. There's a war being fought in hell, and we are losing. That's why I need you to remember. I NEED YOU TO STAY FAR AWAY FROM MURPHY.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Overall, this was a well-written and interesting story. However, there were a few areas that could be improved.\n\nFirst, I would recommend being more concise in your writing. This story tended to ramble in places and could have been tighter. For example, in the second paragraph, you could cut out the sentence about children being easy hosts. This is already implied by the fact that you said they are impossibly fortified.\n\nSecond, I would recommend using more active voice in your writing. There were a few instances of passive voice, which can make your writing sound stilted. For example, in the third paragraph, you could say \"The newbie arrived a couple centuries ago\" instead of \"A couple centuries ago, we got this newbie.\"\n\nFinally, I would recommend using more concrete images and details in your writing. In places, the story felt a bit abstract and could have benefited from more specific images and examples. For example, in the fourth paragraph, you could describe how the newbie took over the lessors' scheme, instead of just saying that he \"turned it against them.\"\n\nOverall, this was a well-written story with an interesting concept. With a few revisions, it could be even better."}

You hear about Sigma males that name their penis, but I hopefully am the only one whose penis told me it's name.\n\n\" What's up bitch? \"\n\nWhat I thought was my urethra turned out to be a mouth, that started to piss on my face - much like a jock would make you a wedgie.  \n\n\"What the fuck?!\" I exclaimed as I tried to wipe my own urine off my face.\n\nLaughing maniacly it quoted the Exorcist \" Do you know what she did?  Your cuntting daughter?\"  \n\nDisturbed, I heard a desperate knocking @ the door.  \"Rich, you gotta get out here man.\"  \n\nCollecting myself and opening the door, I saw what I had been too groggy to see before.  Half the house was missing.  \" Look man,\" Joe said, \" I don't know what's going on but you got alot of explaining to do.\"\n\nThe street was lined with armored vehicles and it seemed as though people were rioting.  The military helicopters flew down above what was left of ms house.  \n\n\" Rich!  Rich!  Hey!

Still seems a little iffy.\"\n\nJulia masticated on a bowl of rice krispies, the pops and crunching mixing with the crackle of the quiet radio in the corner and the downpour of rain on the roof.

Just wet from the rain.\n\n\"Okay, but that doesn't explain the knocking.\"\n\nAs she stands there talking to the wall, Julia remembers that the antique door knocker would swing itself in heavy winds. She hated it, but the historical preservation commission wouldn't allow it to be changed. She opened the door.\n\nThe bunny was shivering in the cold, its light fur soaked with rain and its ears drooping. Julia looked around for others outside and glanced once more at the wall before leaning down to pick up the rabbit.\n\nThe animal was gentle and allowed her to get two hands under its front legs.

It bobbed up and down as he moved, impossible for onlookers to ignore yet he seemed to ignore it, every once in a while trying to suck it back up into his mouth with a churning slurping sound.\n\nIn his hand was a sticky lollipop, strands of hair both human and animal, and tufts of fabric stuck to it. Its red coloring made it look more like an open head wound where one had to sift through the hair to get a good look at the crispy dirtied hemoglobin. The boy then stuck it in his mouth.\n\nThe boy made his way through the disquieting woods. The ground was moist and tender, each step felt like walking on a gigantic tongue marinating in spit and the remnants of unchewed lunch. Each step caused moisture to fizzle and gurgle, squishing up soggy water that smelled like wet dog and mildew towels. The sound was almost like the giant tongue was salivating, the forest\u2019s predatory, hungry gaze savoring the thought of swallowing him up with a dry, throaty gulp.\n\nThe boy smiled as he finally reached a small dog house. His smile was crooked and jagged with teeth crossing and folded over one another that might make a dentist consider tearing them out leaving the child with bleeding gums rather than fixing them with braces, shrugging at the lost cause.\n\nHe took out old moldy bread from his pocket where it had been mixing and mingling with smelly brass keys, melted chocolate goops, and muddy marbles, holding them out in front of the little hovel. A harsh ruff sounded from within, the sound like a sickly person gagging on their own mucus as they try to dispel it from their desiccated lungs.\n\nThe sound belonged to a mangy wolf with a blind, glassy eye, spouts of tangled hairballs stuck to their otherwise wrinkly pink hairless skin which was the same texture as an old rooster\u2019s flabby neck.

Each component was far more expensive than he realized at the outset, and some were deceptively rare.\n\nIt had taken ages to acquire everything he needed. There were few that possessed them. And they were not moved by his plight, the countless letters of inquiry he had sent were silent testament to that.\n\nEven the knowledge of it had cost him dearly. And he paid a price that could not be measured in mundane currencies. For to obtain this knowledge, he had become a betrayer, stealing the secrets from his mentor, cajoling them into surrendering each drip of information until at last he had collected it all.\n\nWhen his mentor learned of the foul deed, he found himself banished from their sight. No matter how he pleaded, they refused to meet his gaze. It was cold comfort to know that this was the way of master and apprentice. The way his mentor had learned the secrets of the trade, through their own act of treachery many moons ago.\n\nFrom above, a light. It was time.\n\nHe set forth the pitiful offering. It seemed so meagre now. Unworthy of such an audience.\n\nHe held back a tear at the thought of all he had lost in pursuit of his dreams.\n\nUp it rose, higher and higher, the broken body torn asunder and carried up to the unblinking eye.\n\nThere was a blinding flash followed by a chorus of laughter.

In a brisk follow, said: \"We think it's a class A2, commander. One of the biggest in the sector.\"\n\nDovken held back a skip. \"You don't say,\" he mumbled through his moustache, broad smile on the up. Finally, he thought. An A2.

Then an eclipse: and it was a body, silhouette fuzzed at the edge, limbs on the towering rise, three red eyes centre the moon-sized head. \n\n\"I'll be damned,\" said Robbins, still wiping the spit from his cheek. \n\n*Jehovah* \n\nwhispered the awe-struck crew. \n\n\"Mother of God,\" gritted Dovken, squeezing the armrests as he pushed the chair back and forth in feverish elation. The men faced forward with skipping heartbeats, rapt, and it was only Dennis whom noticed Dovken's erection when he stood.\n\nJehovah brought down a gargantuan hand hard to the surface and from there a shockwave rippled over the ship, its full mass then exposed as it pulled itself up, four-armed, three-legged, to a several hundred kilometre stand, arms in a muscular flare, mein of lightning-hair brightening to a dazzle, its dangling front-tail dragging smooth a mountain-flattening mile-wide trail.\n\n\"Fire!\" said Dovken.\n\nStaggered torpedos stocked with devil-blood shot from the ship fast though the airless shadow, the creature bare able to pivot in time.

Every other star-faring species had no inclination to faith or spiritualism. Logic. Mathematics. Curiosity. Critical thinking. Self-reflection. These were the repeated and unvarying paths taken to the stars by every species since the dawn of space/time.\n\nThe gods could not bare to be ignored and worse. They could not bare that they had not even been imagined or considered. They could not suffer the silence of the only other sentient things in the universe other than themselves.\n\nSo they struck out. Like any other jealous, neglected, isolated creatures, they acted violently and extremely. They took their vengeance on anything that dared to rise from the muck and reach for the stars with inexplicable occurrences.  \"Miracles,\" humans would call them; but the other mortal minds of the universe lacked not just the word, but the concept.\n\nFrustratingly, however, these miracles became less and less effective. With each extermination, the next species would find the relics of those that had come before them. They would rationalize, engineer, and improve. They would explain the things that had doomed their predecessors and move forward. This erosion of godly power eroded slowly, over billions of years, but constantly and irreversibly. When the last miracle had been spent, only humans remained.\n\nWell, not the last miracle. Humans were new and naive, easily impressed. Tribal and jealous, just like the gods. Susceptible to superstition and prone to the inexplicable. And those were the gravest mistake the gods ever made: making their possible existence needs known.\n\nAnd, so, humanity laid waste to the Enemy by looking at them, collapsing their wave-forms into elementary, predictable, measurable, controllable things.

{"prompt": "Six months ago the mutant, Ransik, began attacking the city of Silverhills with his army of mutant criminals and robots. The city was now always a little tense, never knowing when the next mutant would show its face and try to attack someone seemingly at random, or just cause chaos for no apparent reason. \n\nDr Michael Zaskin, a middle aged man with dark brown hair was head researcher at the company called Bio-lab. He was the one responsible for all the research done on the remains of the robots, the blasters they carried and on the one morpher they had access to. All the technology was beyond anything he'd seen before, beyond anything he'd ever been allowed to study after the alien attacks in Angel Grove. The morpher was sitting on the table in front of him, it's owner, a very serious Asian man with dark hair watched him work like a hawk stalking its prey. He never took his eyes off the red and black device. Dr Zaskin marveled at the device, poking and prodding at it with various instruments. The readings were off the charts, but unless Commander Myers activated it himself, it remained inactive. When activated, it instantly gave the wearer red and black armour, weapons and even a giant mech in the shape of a dinosaur to help keep the city safe. He stood in order to grab another device when the sound he dreaded hearing blared from a speaker above his head. The attack alarm. Commander Myers grabbed his morpher and was gone in an instant. Dr Zaskin walked over to the window overlooking the city streets, he saw the Asian man sprinting off into the distance, towards some unknown threat. He looked beyond and tried to see through the concrete jungle of office blocks and saw nothing. The sun was shining brightly, the leaves of a few trees were blowing in the light breeze that came up from the ocean. The alarm went off and it was all silent again, apart from the ringing in his ears. He went back to his desk and sat back down in the black high backed computer chair. He looked at the readings in front of him and shook his head. Nothing made sense. The morpher came out of an archaeological dig in a layer of sediment from 65 million years ago. The device was millions of years old and yet, the technology was so advanced he was struggling to understand any of it. \n\nHe pushed his keyboard back in frustration then looked down at the piece of paper under it. A currently unsolved equation was scribbled on it with a bunch of his own markings. He picked up his pen and after a few minutes wrote some more on the page, it was like a flip had switched inside his brain and the answer was suddenly there in front of him. \n\n\"Dr Michael Zaskin?\"\n\nThe doctor jumped around so quickly he nearly toppled out of his chair. In the doorway was a man dressed in what looked like a black uniform, but what stunned him the most was that it was his bosses son, Wesley Collins, but it wasn't him, it just looked like him. The man in front of him felt wrong somehow, he didn't stand right, his expression was wrong, he talked with an odd accent. His hair was a darker brown and slicked back with gel.\n\n\"Yes?\" He answered as the man repeated the question. \n\n\"My name is Alex Drake, I'm with the temporal devision of Time Force. I'm here to prevent history from being altered. This equation isn't supposed to be solved for 200 years.\" \n\nDr Zaskin stared at the man. Time Force wasn't a new term to him, that's what the Power Rangers fighting the mutants called themselves. Talking as if time travel was a reality, not just a concept, that made his curiosity peak. He had so many questions but as he opened his mouth, the man in black put his hand up to stop him.\n\n\"You can either forget this and move on, or,\" He moved his long coat and showed off a white blaster, just like what the main team of Rangers used.\n\nThe doctor hadn't studied them, but he knew they were capable of killing a human with ease. He gulped, \"I'll forget, I won't use it,\" he promised and handed the paper to the man, his hands shaking a little. \n\nThe man stood silently, his face blank. He took the paper and put it into an inside pocket before he nodded slightly and left the room without another word. \n\nThe doctor collapsed to the floor and hugged himself, heart pounding, wondering what had just happened. That man, who looked like Wesley but wasn't, he was from the future, at least 200 years, probably further. His mouth fell open. The mutants, the tech he'd been trying to understand, it was all from the future, that's why it was beyond his knowledge. He began to laugh, time travel, it was possible!\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has potential, but there are definitely areas that could use improvement.

The accepted answer of 4 was considered \"the answer\".  2 apples, combined with 2 apples, is 4 apples.  What if...\n\nI got up and wiped the 4 off.  I picked up the temporary marker and wrote 7.

I couldn't make out who this figure was or, hell, what it was, but it had a faint familiarity with it.\n\nI quickly reached for the flashlight but it hits the wall and the dark figure chases after it.

What... what are you?\".  \"I am the buffer between the knowledge you seek, the knowledge you just uncovered, and a tear in reality\" as it removed its hood, I saw a white nose, brown face, fur, pointed ears.

You can't get off the exercise wheel that is societal norms yet.  You see it though, don't you.  The unwritten numbers.  Maybe you don't see them but, you feel them.\"  I walked to the couch, \"I must have slipped and hit my head.  None of this makes sense\".  \"YES!\", Mr. Cheeks exclaimed \"None of it makes sense.  No one takes apples.  No one takes oranges.  When you do subtraction, you're not giving Stacy 4 apples, you're giving her, nothing\".  \n\nAs the word \"nothing\" came out of his mouth in that high squeaky voice, my surroundings started to fade.

Fae also make great bullies, unsurprisingly).\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI can\u2019t fathom why a human might enjoy servitude.

We have no remorse for mortals.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cGood, they are sources of our amusement, nothing more.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI shivered, it seemed so callous. Though Quel, in all fairness, was perhaps the most hedonistic Fae I knew. He mostly uses his thralls to get him wine and carry him to bed after he passes out from too much wine. \u201cAnd sources of your wine.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cAnd that.

I\u2019m much too sober right now, I have to find some wine. Good day, Fel.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI sighed and headed back to my thrall. He turned to me and smiled. Smiled! The nerve of that human. I raised my very long eyebrow, \u201cI am perplexed by you, do you really like being a thrall.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nHe nodded, \u201cIndeed! Never been better! Do all Fae have eyebrows as long as yours?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI glared at him, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare insult my eyebrows you\u2026\u201d\n  \n\n  \nHe yelped, \u201cS..sorry. I wasn\u2019t insulting, they\u2019re nice.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019re freakishly long?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nHe chuckled, \u201cWho told you that?

{"prompt": "When Chale called Robert back, she was pleased. Already he had gotten rid of every last spider in the forest. Now she could rest easy. \"You have done well, Robert. I do believe this calls for a reward.\" Smiling, she took him to her bedroom, wanting to savor what would happen. \"Now, get on the bed.\" Robert, however, calmly turned towards her, calmly saying \"No.\"\n\n\"Robert, it isn't what you think it is, it's only cuddling...\" She decided to backtrack, hoping to persuade him. Perhaps her powers didn't extend that far. Even still, the man shook his head. \"I am no longer required to follow your orders. The demons gave me new commands as well as your name, Chale.\" She was horrified. For such a man to willingly cooperate with demons...\n\nAs she tried running out of her house, she was greeted with the sight of spiders, all facing her. The pattern they were in formed a barrier glyph, sealing her inside. Yet soon that was no more than a precaution as with a flick of his wrist, he shut the door and locked it. As she stood there quivering, with her back to the door, she saw a figure begin to step from the shadows. It had four, no, six arms, white hair, and bright red irises, both filled with the intent to hunt. As it stood to its full height, Robert smiled and spoke a single command.\n\n\"Sic 'em, Anthony.\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very promising, I like the way you establish the setting and introduce the characters. However, the dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. I would recommend working on that.\n\nThe plot takes an interesting turn when Robert refuses Chale's advances. I like the suspense you create here.\n\nThe ending is very shocking and gruesome. I think you did a good job of creating a sense of horror."}
{"prompt": "Darius sat sullenly while Asana paced the cell in which they were locked. She had been fuming for the better part of an hour and he a relatively sure that she would be up for talking soon.\n\n\"What were they thinking!\" Asana yelled suddenly. \n\nDarius kept his voice low. \"Technically we did disobey the law.\"\n\n\"That's stupid and you know it! Almost every city has laws against bringing in weapons, but you and I always have something tucked away for just this scenario. We're mercenaries, godsdammit!\"\n\nDarius held up his hands in acquiescence. Looking at them now, his scarred, calloused hands did feel empty without a broadsword or hand axe. \"I guess they take it more seriously here.\"\n\n\"More seriously than a dragon attack?\" Asana immediately stopped pacing and dropped on the bench next to Darius. \"I got in a good hit with my dagger, but its likely he'll recover from the wound. We should have taken chase, but the guards decided to lock us up and let a monster go loose.\"\n\n\"It'll be fine, Asana. There'll be a fine, we'll get slapped on the wrists, we'll make back the money, and next time a dragon tries to burn down this town, we can ignore it.\"\n\nAsana laughed and laid her head on Darius' shoulder. \"You're right. I'm glad *you* have a cool head at least.\"\n\nSuddenly a sound in the prison put them both on alert. They stood and met the guards at the iron-barred door. The leader of the company was a grim-faced man who stared daggers at the two mercenaries.\n\n\"The Mayor wishes to see you,\" he uttered through clenched teeth.\n\n\"Really?\" Darius asked. \"What does he have to do with this?\"\n\n\"Listen, outlander!\" the guard barked back. \"Be grateful I'm not taking you to the gallows. It took this long for us to decide not charge you for murder!\"\n\n\"Murder!\" Asana yelled. It started the other guards enough to make them raise their weapons. Darius laid a hand on her shoulder and raised another in surrender.\n\n\"Take us to him.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a short walk to the Mayor's Grand Hall. The torches were out in half of the enclosure, leaving the area behind the Mayor's chair in darkness. The mayor was a middle-aged man with greying hair, a comfortable paunch over his belt, and a sour expression. Darius was beginning to think it was the city's customary expression.\n\n\"Have they been searched for weapons?\" The mayor asked in a stern, but tired voice.\n\n\"Yes sire.\" The guard replied. \"Before and after they were imprisoned.\"\n\n\"Very well. You can leave us.\"\n\nSoon, Darius and Asana were alone with the mayor. He stood and approached them. \n\n\"My name is Jairus, and I am the mayor of this fine city. I take it you think our town is a bit odd.\"\n\n\"Odd!\" Asana exclaimed. Darius attempted to intervene, but she said, \"Not now! We try to take down a dragon that descended in the middle of the market, and you arrest us for having an emergency weapon ready? And the guard claims that we could have been charged for murder? I think that is a bit more than odd!\"\n\nJairus' lips drew into a thin line. \"May I ask you, young lady, what harm the dragon offered you?\"\n\nAsana blinked. \"I-it's a dragon!\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\nDarius stepped forward. \"I believe what she is trying to express is that dragon's are generally seem as a hazard to peaceful folk. It's what dragons do. We tend to hire ourselves out as protectors, and we thought that it would be best to strike preemptively to keep as many safe as possible.\"\n\n\"So talking was out of the question for this encounter?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\"\n\nThe mayor became more animated, \"You decided to attack without first trying any form of diplomacy. Now I have a mess to clean in the markets and my daughter's husband is being treated for mortal wounds!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, was he harmed by the dragon?\"\n\n\"No,\" Came a voice from behind the mayor. The voice was resonant and laced with growls. From the direction of the voice came a glob of fire that ignited a ring of torches. \"He *was* the dragon.\"\n\nThe green-scaled beast was sprawled behind the mayor's chair and a portion of its hindquarters where Asana had thrown the was layered with red-stained bandages. Darius and Asana stood agape, but the side door to the hall was opened before they could respond. A young woman ran in and wrapped her arms around the dragon.\n\n\"Nax! Are you well? I told the maids to keep the lights down!\"\n\n\"Lise, you coddle me like a wingless drake. I am well enough; no thanks to you two.\" The dragon shot a glare at the mercenaries.\n\n\"He's proud, but he will survive the wound,\" Jairus explained to Darius. \"We were forced to imprison you until we addressed the severity of the wound. Had he been killed outright, I would have needed to exile you at the very least. Tarrinax has become the very soul of our little city.\"\n\nAsana was still staring with wide eyes, so Darius said, \"I don't understand, sir.\"\n\n\"I was like you once, but my daughter showed me that not all beasts are beastly, if you see what I mean. When I was younger, I could not have imagined my daughter marrying a flying lizard, but now I cannot imagine life without him.\"\n\nSuddenly, Asana stepped forward. Her hands were still bound behind her, but she strode directly in front of Tarrinax. The great dragon tensed and began to extend his wings at the protestations of the young lady, but he stopped when Asana knelt before him.\n\n\"Great, and gentle Tarrinax,\" She said with her eyes toward the floor. \"I am sorry for having harmed you. I was in error and I make no excuse for myself. Will you ever forgive me?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Tarrinax rumbled. He stretched his neck forward and pressed his snout against her head. \"That's what dragons do.\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story sets up the conflict nicely. I like the dialogue between Darius and Asana, it sounds natural and gives us a good sense of their characters. However, the story feels a bit rushed after they are taken to see the mayor. We don't get much description of the mayor or the dragon, and the resolution feels very abrupt.\n\nIt would be helpful to slow down the pace a bit and give us more description, especially of the dragon. What does he look like? How does he act? Why is he the soul of the city? Answering these questions would help to make the story more enjoyable for readers."}
{"prompt": "Jack and Lana got out of the van and headed into the local grocery store hand in hand.  Dave leaned over an asked his sister, \"How long do you think they are gonna take this time?  We're already three days behind schedule.\"  \"I don't know.  Maybe if they didn't stop to kiss every time no one was looking, they could actually get something done for once.\" His sister Maria responded while rolling her eyes.\n\nThirty-five minutes later Jack and Lana exited the store while talking with an attractive couple.  The four headed to the car where Lana excitedly introduced her cousins Dave and Maria to the couple. \n\nThe man's name was Darryl and his wife's name was Suzanne, and surprisingly she was the mayor's daughter.  \"So how did you two meet?\" Maria asked after about twenty minutes of conversation, starved as she was for someone other than her three care mates to talk to.\n\n\"Oh Darryl has been a friend of the family for generations, but when daddy found out about the two of us, he nearly blew his beard out what with all that yellin'.\" Suzanne said in a southern drawl.  The four looked at her quizzically, and Jack queried \"Generations?\" \n\n \"Thou shall have to forgive this one's dear mate, she amuses herself with adopting the unique accent of her cousins from the south.  As for the shouting young Mathew partook of at the time, twas mostly from fear of the age difference of this one and this one's mate.  This one still finds it humorous how mortals perceive time, as well as the assumption that this one would allow it's ravages to leave even the smallest of traces upon this one's mate's form.\"  Darryl spoke in a strange deep rumbling, yet lilting accent, \"Afterall this one has known young Mathew's kin ever since they settled upon this land seven generations ago and this one struck a bargain for this one's assistance in establishing this settlement.\" \n\nThe travelers just sat there not sure whether this was all some big joke or not.  Unsure of what to do, Lana asked, \"So, how did you convince your father? He is the mayor right?\"  \"Yep. Dad's the mayor big whoop. All I had to do was nag him, plus remind him it would be killing two birds with one stone and eventually after two years he caved.\" Suzanne said while seemingly pouting about getting sold out, she had dropped the southern drawl though. \n\n\"Ah, yes this one's mate refers to the barging struck some time ago with young Thaddeus.\" Darryl remarked.  \"What was the deal?\" Dave asked, finally having his interest peaked by this weird conversation. \n\n \"That the firstborn daughter of my great-great-great-great-grandfather's bloodline would seek his acknowledgement before finding a husband, and any potential 'mate' of hers would have to be approved by him.\" Suzanne smirked at this point, \"It just so happens that while attempting to gain his acknowledgement, I fell in love with him. So win-win in my opinion.\"\n\nMaria then redirected the conversation elsewhere for another twenty minutes, before Jack said, \"Well, it's getting late and we still have to check into the inn here in town for the night. So maybe we'll see you tomorrow before we leave. It was nice meeting you.\"\n\n\"Twas this one's pleasure to make your aquantince as well.  This on bids thee a good evening.\" Darryl said.\n\"Likewise.\" Suzanne commented.\n\"You too.\" Lana, Dave and Maria responded awkwardly.\n\n\"By the way, where's your car?\" Maria asked curiously. \n\"Why would we ever need one of those?\" Darryl asked in a normal voice.\nThe four of them just stared at him for a moment before Dave shrieked at what happened next.\n\nDarryl's skin changed to a deep black with an iridescent sheen as scales appeared on him, a pair of magnificent wings sprouted from his back as he increased in size to a length of about a hundred feet long.  He leaned his head right up in front of them and his wife climbed on to his back and grasped the spike in front of her.  \"No one will ever believe you.\" Darryl said as he stuck out his tongue while winking and then launched himself into the air, and flew away while laughing \"ahahahahahahaha.\"\n\n\n\n\nEpilougue \n\nThe four were silent all that night other than procuring accommodations at the inn. This silence carried all the way until they were leaving town the next morning. As Maria looked out the window at the sky she could have sworn she saw two dragons dancing the sky, a black one like the one they saw last night and one with a blue color that strangely reminded her of the outfit worn by Suzanne last night. After rounding a bend in the road she could no longer see them, but it made her wonder, just what did being a dragon's mate entail?\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story was very interesting and well-written. I particularly liked the ending, which left the reader wondering what could happen next.\n\nThere were a few areas that could be improved, however.

{"prompt": "It was fairly early on a Tuesday morning so I was in my usual spot of leaning on a broom just out of sight of the registers.  If Mr. Henley walked my direction it'd be easy enough to start pantomiming sweeping, but otherwise there was very little to do until the rush when people got off work at the quarry.  Until then it was either lean on a broom or count the cans of tomato soup again. There were still 37 of those by last count, so today I was leaning on the broom.\n\n\"Now, Our Shep,\" Henley spoke up from around the corner, \"What manner of contraption do ya kin that to be?\"\n\nMr. Henley is my boss and the owner of the only grocery store in town. The only, well, any store in town, in fact. The place was just called \"Store\" as it didn't need another name. If you needed gas, a wedding dress, or a frozen turkey there was only one place to get it. Much like how the post office didn't need its own name either.  As best we can tell, Mr. Henley is from right here in Ascalon which makes his eccentric patois all the more incomprehensible. Everyone is either an \"Our\" or \"His\" in his world. You are either \"Our David\" or \"His David.\" He's never clarified who this mythical male who seems to own half the town might be. But, using some internal logic that no one else can decipher, he wants everyone, even the person he is addressing, to know which David, Paul, or Shepherd - that's me by the way - he is talking about so we don't mix it up with that other guys.  Considering Henley has been set in his ways since roughly the time steam engines were considered the next big thing, we just stopped arguing with him about it.\n\nI made a big production of coming out of the aisle while sweeping and shot him a look like he was interrupting my diligence. I needn't have bothered. He only had eyes for the vehicle pulling up to the empty parking lot in front of Store. I took one look at the chrome finished RV with its myriad of antenna and his and her kayaks strapped to the roof and my heart fell.\n\n\"Oh no,\" I moaned, \"Glampers!\"\n\n\"Whazzat?\" Henley asked, \"Cankers?\" \n\nI didn't really feel a point in correcting him there. I didn't really have time as the doors flew open to reveal the L.L. Bean interior and a man and woman wearing brand new flannel shirts, designer vests, and designer hiking shoes never intended to touch dirt leaped out and started walking towards the door. This was bad.  This was very bad.\n\nThe only road that leads into or out of our little mountain town is Route No. 9.  According to my grandfather, they followed a snake while paving the road and had to stop once it broke it's back three times trying to make the turns. Grandpa, however, was prone to exaggeration so it was probably only two times. What I am trying to say is the road is narrow, winding, and follows a path of steep up and down hills that no sane person who had a choice would ever voluntarily follow if they didn't have to.  Due to our relative inaccessibility, Mr. Henley had yet to meet this bizarre species of moisturizing not so rough and tumble folks who wanted to bring a touch of the Marriott to the great outdoors. Steep learning curve on both sides coming up, I thought.\n\nThe bell tinkled as the man stepped inside first. He was tall, fit in a twice a week in the gym/spa sort of way, and handsome. Something about him just shouted he worked in a bank and lost other people's money for them in idiotic investments. The woman who followed him was short, blonde, and probably stored inside a glass case when he didn't take her out to impress his friends.  Mr. Henley watched both of them from the cash register and scowled. There was something about them he didn't like. I could tell without looking they were now His Yuppies.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" the stranger boomed as if he were talking to a particularly lifelike statue, \"Can you tell us where we are?\"\n\nHenley regarded them coldly for all of three seconds before replying.\n\n\"Well, young man,\" he said, drawing out each word like a razor across a barber's strop, \"This here is called a 'grocery store.'\"\n\nThe strange man blinked slowly. To me, the message couldn't be clearer if Mr. Henley had shoved them both out the door, pointed back to the highway, then locked the door and killed the lights.  You are not welcome here.  This, apparently, was a foreign concept to the man so  he, naturally, decided Mr. Henley must be the moron in this exchange and tried again.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I mean what's the name of the town? I can't find it on the GPS .\"\n\n\"Is that right?\" Mr. Henley replied.  He didn't volunteer anything else. From somewhere else in the store I heard another voice - also male but both much louder and deeper - announce, \"Look!  La Choy! It's like an entire supper in a can!\"\n\nUh oh.  I had forgotten Tuesdays were Dylan's shopping days. This was definitely bad news.\n\nI could only stare helplessly and around the corner came Dylan. All twelve feet of him.  He had to bend his serpentine neck almost double to keep his horned head from digging furrows in our ceiling.\n\nBehind Dylan I could just barely see the plump and smiling face of his wife pushing their shopping cart.  I was pretty sure I was the only one looking at her, though, as everyone else had eyes only for the two glampers or, in their case, the giant purple dragon with twin plumes of smole wafting from his nostrils.\n\n\"Morning, Dylan,\" Henley said without missing a beat, \"You find everything?\"\n\n\"Did I ever!\" the dragon boomed, \"I was just telling the missues about La Choy!\"\n\n\"Entire supper in a can, ain't she?\" Henley said with a knowing nod.  Dylan laughed at this and playfully gave a backhand nudge to his wife's arm. I could tell it was playful as her arm was still attached to her body.\n\n\"See?\" Dylan said, \"He knows!\"  \n\n(continue to Part 2 below)\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening paragraph is good.

{"prompt": "I was 14 years old the first time I killed a man. He came to our village, squirrelled away in the mountains, looking to kill my father. The man he was hoping to find was long gone, what was left in his place was a frail, destitute thing that still clung on for dear life. To sup whatever droplets he could, at least a little longer. My father's legs didn\u2019t work right and he\u2019d crawl around our hut peering out the bottoms of the shutters. He spotted the man early and told me what I\u2019d have to do. When the man had my father at the end of his sword I came up behind him and bludgeoned him to death with a rock. I never saw his face, even when I dragged his corpse off into the woods to bury. All I remember is the wry smile on my father\u2019s face\u2026 like a peasant watching a king hanging from a rope.\n\nTwo years later, at the end of a bottle, my father told me who the man was. Fifteen years ago my father worked in the Regent\u2019s Guard. He was lower standing then, and was tasked with stopping a plague that came from the farming communities. So he was told. Rather than waste time trying to convince the peasants to confine themselves he simply executed them all.\n\nThe man I killed was a survivor.\n\n\u2018Funny, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 He laughed. Not only did he not kill them all, but he got the same bloody disease only a decade later. Turns out, not the farmers\u2019 fault. For some reason it\u2019d make him laugh and laugh. He\u2019d laugh so hard I thought he would die. Wished it.\n\nSo you see even from the start of all this, I knew there was a rot \u2014 in both of us.\n\nAfter he told me I left home. I took the man\u2019s armour. I even took his name \u2014 Aan \u2014 hoping to earn any karmic favour for him that I could.\n\nBut of course I should\u2019ve known.\n\nMy father\u2019s training set me apart from many others and I quickly gained the employ under a Duke. I thought I would be able to do any justice. Instead all we did was keep serfs in line, extract payments from merchants and craftsmen, and segregate the poor from any rightful discourse with their liege. The night we were told to burn a man\u2019s home down I could see myself standing in my father\u2019s shoes. I had had enough. It wasn\u2019t ever going to change. I left.\n\nEvery time I held a sword in my hand its blade etched only misery. So I wandered off into the woods. I drank until my brain was mush and drool leaked from my face. I found a shallow crevice lined with moss and toadstools, laid down, closed my eyes, and waited to die.\n\nThe howl of a beast ripped through the forest trees. Maybe I\u2019d get lucky and he\u2019d tear out my throat. It\u2019d be quicker. But then I heard the screams of people. I tried to stay down, I really did. But the adrenaline cleared my vision and I couldn\u2019t hear a damn thing over my fucking heart. Wasn\u2019t going to die like this. I got up and held my blade tight and followed the screams.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but they called it the Blightwolf. It had been hunting and feeding on people for months. Funny I hadn\u2019t heard a word about it when I worked for the Duke. I just thought it was some mangey, overgrown wolf. I found it at the edge of the forest clawing away at some poor woman, and some soon to be victims nearby. Getting its attention was hard \u2014 I was still a little drunk \u2014 but once I put a dagger in its hind leg it got real attentive.\n\nIt was a blinding streak of fangs, claws, red eyes, and brown-yellow fur. I didn\u2019t have the movement I needed to dodge him effectively so all I could do was give him an armoured forearm and pray I\u2019d go through him faster than he went through me. It was close, let me tell you. Cutting out the bottom of a wolf gives you a fat great present of innards all over your favourite clothes and I swear I still catch its scent sometimes.\n\nAfter the Blightwolf slumped over the night caught up to me and I puked my guts out. Not because of the wolf \u2014 because of the drinking. I think.\n\nBut the people, they were still there. The woman, she was alright. Her arms were a bit torn up, but nothing critical. She came over and hugged me, really, through the guts \u2018n all.\n\nAan, this has to count, right? For the first time? \n\nSure feels like it counts.\n\nThey dragged me to their tiny little hut out in the farmlands. To call it a hut is the gravest of insults. The warmth in that place, and the food they shoved down my throat\u2026 no king nor duke could ever match. I tried to tell them not to waste it on me but they wouldn\u2019t hear a damn word. You see, them, and others are leaving. A pilgrimage away from this shithole of a kingdom. And there\u2019s a lot more than just the Blightwolf out there. Months of these beasts picking on anyone trying to cross the forests to the other kingdom. They could use someone like me.\n\nSometimes when I\u2019m laying in bed at night, I feel like I\u2019m in that shallow crevice in the forest. If ever I look in the mirror and see my father, I\u2019ll walk out there and finish the job. But that can wait. These people need help... and I might just be able to help them. And if I can\u2019t, well, the beasts\u2019ll do the job for me. And my bones\u2019ll end up in that grave all the same.\n\nI think, for now, I can keep walking. And maybe there\u2019s half a hope for me yet.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of your story is very strong. You give just enough backstory to provide context without bogging down the narrative. The use of sensory detail is also very effective in setting the scene. However, there are a few places where your grammar could be improved. For example, you use the word \"but\" at the beginning of a sentence when you should use \" however\". There are also a few places where you could use stronger verbs to add more impact to your writing.\n\nOverall, you have created a very atmospheric and engaging story. Well done."}
{"prompt": "\"Kill me.\"\n\nThe Minotaur smashed its club into the tiles, right where Mat had been standing a moment before. The stone splintered and flew across the room, sending onlookers scattering. Mat was now behind the Minotaur, the Sword of Dawn gleaming in his hand. A minotaur outside of its labyrinth was rare, but inside a city? Unreal. Times were getting hard. But monsters were constant. They had come after him, one after the other.\n\n\"Just kill me!\"\n\nThe Minotaur wound up, throwing the club like a javelin, aimed straight at Mat's head. No way he could dodge this. Out of reflex, he held the sword in front of him, the flat of the blade facing the beast. He had done this move many times before, against humans, harpies, and even the occasional manticore. Any projectile-based foe, really. The Sword of Dawn glowed the color of the shifting sky. When the club connected, though it was three times the size of the Mat, it stopped, its momentum turning to absolutely nothing. It shattered then, projectiles the size of human heads scattering in random directions, connecting with buildings. Mat's heart thrummed, and he felt his body vibrate down to its very core. This one was strong.\n\n\"Kill me, you dumb beast!\"\n\nThe Minotaur matched Mat's cry with a roar. It leaned down, horns pointed at Mat, clawed hands held out to the sides. Any of those sharp ends would instantly skewer Mat.\n\n\"Yes! Come on, do it!\"\n\nThe Minotaur charged, closing the gap in between the man and beast with frightening speed. Mat moved, flowing effortlessly to a defensive stance, in a position to parry whatever sharp end approached him. As the Minotaur came within reaching distance of him, he swung -\n\n\\- only to feel the blunt end of the Minotaur's hoof strike him directly in the gut. Mat went flying, colliding with a stone wall on the other end of the square. He felt something crack, and his vision filled with spots. A breath later, and a warmth filled him, the Sword of Dawn turning the color of the moon as it lingers in the morning. Bones shifted back into place, and Mat groaned. He stood up. That hadn't happened in... ever. Since the first monster, maybe.\n\n\"That wasn't enough! Kill me, please!\"\n\nThe Minotaur stood for a second, its bovine face allowing for the briefest expression of what Mat thought was shock. Whatever. It was now Mat's turn to close the gap. With speed matching that of the Minotaur's, he ran in, the Sword of Dawn slicing upwards. The minotaur brought its hard claws and muscular arms to block it, but there was no resistance. The arms fell away immediately, severed totally. Whatever townsfolk were still remaining cheered.\n\n\"Not good enough. Not good enough to end me.\"\n\nMat didn't shout this time, as he methodically sliced the legs and horns of the Minotaur, now a bleeding torso in the middle of the town square. He stepped onto its massive chest, the Sword of Dawn pointed at its throat. It rasped, dark eyes staring at Mat's tired face.\n\n\"I am... sorry... Mat. I... I tried. I will... see you, when the -\"\n\nThe sword cut through Gavyn the Minotaur's neck. The Sword of Dawn pulsed a blood-like red. The brightness, the vitality, the weight of the beast in front of Mat began to wither away. As it did, the sword pulsed brighter and faster.\n\nRight after the kill. That's when the sword gave him enough control to move. As the townsfolk chanted his name, lifted him up, hugged him, cried for him. As the world grew to love him more. Mat could only sit in mute silence. All of the time to resist, and he did nothing. Not even a 'kill me.\"\n\nThey had come after him, one after the other. His friends. Gavyn had been the strongest. The sword knew this, and it thrummed with a greedy joy. Not many monsters left now. It would kill them all, and relish the ones that Mat had grown with the most. It would kill them all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after that, who knows?\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some work. First, your descriptions could be more vivid. For example, when the Minotaur smashes its club into the tiles, you could describe the sound it makes, or the look on its face. Additionally, you could describe the setting in more detail, so that readers can picture the scene more clearly.\n\nSecond, your dialogue could be more natural. In particular, the dialogue between Mat and the Minotaur feels stiff and unnatural. You could try to make it more conversational, so that it sounds like two people (or a person and a beast) talking to each other.\n\nOverall, your story is intriguing and has a lot of potential. With some more work on your descriptions and dialogue, it could be even better."}
{"prompt": "\"Here's to our new hero! Where he comes from we don't know! But he slew our greatest foe!\" Cheered the young man standing atop a long table in the tavern with a raised flagon of ale.\n\nEveryone else in the packed tavern raised their flagons as well all roaring an exuberant hurrah before swigging down their ale. It was a jovial festive atmosphere. The warmly lit wooden inn was alive with song and dance. Merriment filled the air as the townsfolk celebrated with one another at the slaying of their horrible monster. Sitting at the end of the tavern atop a wood carved throne adorned in floral leys and other decorative pieces, the triumphant hero sits unenthused. With his head resting on his hand, the festivities before him were of no interest to him, neither were the droves of townsfolk at his feet drowning him in their thanks and praises. Their tributes of treasures in gratitude did not phase the hero, neither did the pleads from the townswomen to spend the night with him. The hero said no words, he merely lightly shooed them away back to their celebration. Finally one of the townsman corralled the crowd away from the hero, insisting on letting him have his rest. Surely enough they disappeared back into the crowd, leaving the hero ignored on the throne. Several minutes passed before the hero simply got up form his seat and slunk out the back door, leaving behind the riches and wenches.\n\nThe muffled sound of music and shouts faintly make it to the ears of our hero whom sits alone by the great lake near the tavern. Sitting in the mud, listening to the small waves gently lapping on the shore, the full moon reflecting off the undulating water. With the entire town in the tavern, the crestfallen hero languished in his solitude; until he heard an old scratchy voice behind him.\n\n\"A masked hero!\" The old voice creaked.\n\nThe hero barely reacting, slowly turning his head to make eye contact with a withered hunchback old man wrapped in a cowl.\n\n\"You see my eyes old man, I have no mask. Are you blind?\" The hero curtly asked.\n\n\"Oh no, son. In fact, I see better then most. In fact, I am the only one who sees the mask; and what is beyond the mask.\" The strange old man said in a wise tone.\n\n\"You speak in riddles? I care not to participate. I wear no mask. Now please, leave me be.\" The hero coldly replied turning his gaze back towards the river.\n\n\"Denial will get you nowhere masked hero. I see the mask you wear that no one else sees. I know this because I have been following your exploits, Iestyn\" The old man revealingly said\n\nThe hero perked up, he had not told his name to anyone for a long time. He stood up and drew his sword pointing it at the old man who did no flinch. Iestyn demanded to know the old man's identity.\n\n\"Oh brave hero, you were in my village many many months ago. You saved us all from the great bog monster without anyone having to ask. The way you threw yourself at it with such recklessness, with such a lack of concern for your own well being had me curious. So I followed you in the shadows. I followed your distinct pattern. Every monster you fight is stronger than the last. Every vengeful spirit you vanquish makes you more chaotic. It is as if  you almost hope that the next fight will be your last.\" The old man concernedly croaked.\n\nIestyn's sword slowly lowered, sensing no threat from the crone.\n\n\"I see the mask you wear and I see through it. You wore it when you came into this town with your gallantry. You donned a new one when you accepted the thanks and the gold of the townsfolk. You took it off when you came here, but quickly put it back on when you heard my voice.\" The old man's smugness replaced with sincerity.\n\nThe tip of Iestyn's sword was now stuck in the dirt. Iestyn dropped it, letting it land with a thud. His face grimaced, his eyes welling with tears, he averted his gaze towards the ground to avoid the old man's gaze.\n\n\"You know nothing of me, old man.\" Iestyn sniveled.\n\n\"I don't know your history. I don't know your story. But I know what I see in front of me. I see pain. A type of pain not cured by salves or medicine. A pain that grows like a cancer within your being. A pain that you think will only end at death.\" The old man caringly says. He slowly approaches Iestyn who remains silent, the old man sees the tears rolling down his cheeks.\n\n\"I know that I can offer you your last fight.\" The old man whispered.\n\nIestyn perked up at the old man. He demanded to know more about this fight. The old man simply gestured for Iestyn to follow him, and the two made their way out of the town, leaving the fading sounds of the tavern behind them.\n\nThe pair make their way to the old man's camp, set up just on the outskirts of the town. Walking into the tent, Iestyn sits down on the ground, neglecting the many chairs around him. The old man rummages through his belongings, clattering sounds fill the tent as the old man searches. The cluttering stops, the old man slowly rises and turns to Iestyn, holding a potion in his hand. Iestyn asks what the potion is.\n\n\"This is the potion that will bring you to your last battle. The final fight you have been looking for.\" The old man beamed.\n\nIestyn glared at the old man with uncertainty.\n\n\"It's quite safe, if that's what you're wondering.\" The old man says as he uncaps the phial and takes a sip from it.\n\n\"It has no effect on me, for I have already fought this battle, many decades ago.\" The old man proudly states.\n\n\"Tell me of this battle I will fight. What is my opponent?\" Iestyn inquires.\n\n\"Im afraid that wouldn't be of help. For the fight is different for everyone. I suppose the best description I could give is...you will fight a demon of extraordinary power.\n\nAt the mention of the opponent, Iestyn leaps to his feet and snatches the bottle from the old man's hand and proceeds to drink all of it. Upon finishing it he tosses it on the ground shattering it to pieces.\n\n\"How characteristic.\" The old man grumbles.\n\n\"Now show me where this demon is. This potion unveils its invisibility? It will help me detect it?\" Iestyn eagerly questions as he draws his sword in anticipation.\n\n\"To fight this demon, all you need do is walk out of my tent.\" the old man ominously said lifting his wrinkled hand pointing it towards the exit.\n\nIestyn turns and bursts out of the tent ready to fight but his spirit quickly drains from him. After stepping out of the tent, all Iestyn sees is a black void in front of him. The ground, the sky, all pitch black, a never-ending nothingness. Iestyn quickly whips around to find the tent again but it was gone, only eternal blackness. Iestyn turned in all directions, he could his sword, his arms, yet there was no light emanating from anywhere. He felt his feet on solid ground but it had no form, only blackness. Frightened and wary, Iestyn slowly paces forward holding his sword at the ready. He probes the air searching for any type of matter to come in contact with. There is no sound, no smell, no sight, only the endless void.\n\n\"I see, you have finally come to slay me.\" echoed an insidious voice seemingly from nowhere.\n\nIestyn whipped around to find the voice, he looked in all directions but found nothing. Silence took hold of the void again.\n\n\"You fool. You've searched for me in all of the monsters you have slain. You look for me in all the wrong places.\" the eerie voice echoed louder.\n\nIestyn now erratically moves his head in all directions hoping to find the phantom.\n\n\"You fight powerful beings, hoping for them to destroy you. Hoping that in each fight you will be delivered to a void like this. But you would still never be free of me.\" The echoes grew louder as if right behind Iestyn. Iestyn worriedly darts his head and sword around, trying to catch the elusive voice. The voice begins to laugh.\n\n\"All this time, you searched far and wide to find me. But you forgot one crucial place to look.\" The devious voice echoed into Iestyn's ear.\n\nIestyn violently turned, holding his sword at the ready. What Iestyn saw chilled him to the bone. Standing at the opposite end of his blade Iestyn saw himself. An almost carbon copy, light blue eyed, long flowing black hair, the scar on his left cheek, and clad in the very armor he now wears.\n\n\"The only place you didn't to look...was within!\" Iestyn's doppelganger growled.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very well done, you set the scene and mood nicely. I especially like the detail about the \"wood carved throne adorned in floral leys and other decorative pieces.\" This gives the reader a good sense of what the tavern looks like. However, there is one thing that I think you could improve. When the hero is sitting on the throne, you could describe his body language a bit more. Right now it just says that he is unenthused and has his head resting on his hand. Maybe you could say that he is slouched over, or that he looks tired and defeated.\n\nWhen the old man comes in and starts talking to the hero, I think you could describe the hero's reaction a bit more. Right now it just says that he is perked up and that his sword is lowered. Maybe you could say that he looks surprised, or that he looks interested in what the old man has to say.\n\nOverall, I think you have a good story here. The dialogue is well done and the characters are interesting. I think you could just add a bit more description in some places to really bring the reader into the story."}
{"prompt": "I was born in japan, on the night of a full moon. And on a night just like my birth, my village was slaughtered by a ruthless sorcerer. He commanded a ruthless army of shikigami. I was twelve years old when I hid with my mother in the forest temple. The temple of the mountain god.\n  \n\n  \nI prayed for the power to do something, the strength to fight back against this sorcerer and his powerful army of shikigami. I heard my father choke to death on his own blood, and watched my mother beheaded while defending me. I felt her warm blood on my face and stared into her lifeless eyes.\n  \n\n  \nThat's when I saw it appear next to me. The mountain kami, it was terrible, thousands of eyes covering a human shaped black hole of a person. Four armed, winged, ears on its head like a hare. Gaping mouths all over its torso. It reached for my hand, I didn't know what to do, so I grabbed hold, hoping it would help me.\n  \n\n  \nThat night I killed over a hundred shikigami. The sorcerer, the mountain kami inside of me consumed him. That was the night I discovered monsters were real, and that we worshipped them.\n  \n\n  \nBut there are far worse things out there. I can name them, each and every one. The kami tells me their names, what they are, and we destroy them.\n  \n\n  \nMy mother, a yuki onna, still haunts me. She guides me, warns me. And the mountain god is still here with me. Since that day when it entered my body, people call me \u201cUsagi sama.\u201d I am the vengeful hare at night, and by day I am Kohaku Yamazaki.\n  \n\n  \nI was trained as a samurai from age thirteen by Ishikawa sensei. Until one of my peers killed him, and then I became a rounin at the age of eighteen.\n\n\n\n  \nI caught up to Ikeda not long after. He thought he could stop me by cutting off my hand, but in his hubris and laughter, he found out that I was not the man I appeared to be. My hand reformed itself, and without my sword, I tore Ikeda's head from his body. I left it as a warning in the town square with the words, \u201cbetrayer of his sensei\u201d written in ink on his kimono.\n  \n\n  \nThis kami, it has claimed my soul. I've fought snake women thousands of times my size. I've killed yokai that crush men in one hand. I've eviscerated highway spirits that trick travellers into giving them a ride, only to kill them. And the truth is, I think I'm becoming the monster. Perhaps I've always been a monster, as much as villagers cheer, \u201cUsagi sama! You saved us!\u201d and \u201cUsagi sama, the hero!\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI don't know rest. I can't comprehend what it's like to not live like a vagabond. To not beg, and take up shelter with strangers. I long for the embrace of another human being. I can't rest, not with this yokai inside of me. It craves blood and violence in the night; while I crave my mother speaking reassurances.\n  \n\n  \nSometimes I do hear her at night. But it's torture, knowing that she's as damned as I am. Trapped in a place between. I know it won't let me die. I should've died countless times before. I've been bisected by the axe of an oni. Exsanguinated by the claws of a vengeful yurei. And even beheaded by a possessed samurai.\n  \n\n  \nIt's been well over a thousand years of this now. This spirit won't let me die. Together we are the vengeful Usagi sama. Destroyer of ghosts, eater of vile spirits, exterminator of things that lurk and take human life.\n  \n\n  \nThe kami inside me comes to me at night. Often in the shape of a beautiful woman, sometimes as a man. I've hated it. I hated the hell it had put me through. I wished my life would end.\n  \n\n  \nAs much as I have hated Shion, the former mountain god. They have brought me the comfort I need to continue. I still long for death, for rest. But now I long for them when I die. I long for the embraces that they have given me, the soft comfort. The whispers of Shion's voice are everything.\n  \n\n  \nAnd so I will continue fighting, until the day when Shion chooses to free me from living. Until we can be together in the spirit world.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The beginning of your story is very strong, you set the scene well and introduce the main character.

He desperately tries to gather a flock of birds in his arms, trying to keep them locked but there is always one who flays up and rushes around in search of an exit.\n\nThe more I watch the spectacle, the more I ponder on whether I should have convinced him to secure the throne room instead. Not that it will be needed to, but I dare hope to spare him of the mockery whenever he tries to help, bless his heart. \"I see that dear, but need I remind you of the last time?\" I would have cursed it back then many times, but his blinding *na\u00efvet\u00e9* and silly overbearing smile have somehow wormed their way in and will never let me go. \n\nMy dear poor, sweet fool seems to have given up in his lonesome conquest and turns to the guards standing at the gate: \"Help me, if you please,\" he shouts, supposedly in what he hopes to be a harsh and commanding tone fitting to his stature and status. It instead resembles the wailing of small dirty mutt, eyeing a pair of ribs out of it's reach. Adorable.\n\nI glimpse over to the soldiers, trying hard to maintain their composure, only a few snickers emerge from under their helmets, stopping once they notice me. Figments of smoke darken up the surroundings, unnoticed by the jolly plumpy man who focuses on the geese around him - deaf to the crackling of the lightning springing and hissing about, as if the dawn of a rainy morning is brightend up by the awakening sun and tears the sky open with unbearable noise - the punishment this pestilence daring to insult their king will face themselves. The men pale only so slightly, the large bafoon in front of them doesn't see or notice it, only the slits in their helms reveal their eyes, wide and shaking at my sight.\n\n\"Well, what about it?\" The lovely fool asks again, more perplexed now. The iron gear quakes and squeaks quietly as the soldiers move in a hurry, their gaze flickering ever so often towards me, clouded in the dark fog, uncontrollable strings of light shooting up from the tip of my hands. \"O-of course, my lord\".\n\nIt takes a while before I breathe out ever so slightly, whisking away the mist in front of me. I cannot afford more problems, especially not concerning respect towards their king. My gaze wanders to the great windows, expanding into the fields and meadows of my empire. In the far off distance, the red-blue colors of the Mazkarian empire float calmly in the wind, the top of their yellow, red and green tents raking upon the hills like mountain tops out of clouds.\n\nSeeing the ruckus he has caused, I do not doubt that my dear Magnus will succeed with his distraction - but I am more than certain of the feast that Claudius and his men will hold afterwards. A mere number of birds might inconvenience the king, but it may also serve him and his hunters in practice of easy targets.\n\nThe sound of shrieks of both animal and human behind me clutches my head in an iron grip and scratches thin at my nerves. My fingers snip up towards the cluster at my sight, cold seeping through the walls, moving fast and without any visible mark, until it has grasped at it's target and both soldiers and birds are frozen in their movement. The stifling chuckle in my chest raises Magnus attention towards me, who had dared not to move before he notices my amusement. \n\nHis gaze drops slightly, one hand coming up to scratch at the back of head: \"I apologize for the trouble, my love\" He gazes up to me, reeking of self-disappointment. He might have caught onto the laughs and scornful looks, now guilty of his ineptitude and inability to provide help for the upcoming battle. \n\nI shake my head slowly, presenting him a tender smile. His appearance and demeanor had been both a light and inconvenience in my measly day, but it his genuine sense of what seems good and right as well as his loyalty that has endeared me to him. I reach out to my dear, his head leaning onto the shoulder of the hyacinth coat, covering the slightly brighter tight-puffed sleeves latched onto the golden sprinkled gown. My hand comes to softly stroke his arm, up to his shoulder and then the slight stubble on his cheek, not fully grown like the goatee I adore.\nI lean up tentatively to peck at his lips, securing a slight smile but still apologetic look from my husband.\n\n\"Don't be, my dear. Your idea was quite amusing, although simple-minded.\" He scowls a bit at this, a bit hurt by the comment before I sweep my palm over his face, fingers caressing his hazelnut hair. \"But what matters to me is that you tried dear. And that you tried to do so for my interest.\" His face brightens up a bit, eyes sparkling like the sun shining through leaves at the peak of the woods. A warmth exudes within my chest, similar to the first time he made me this smile, beaming up at me from a cell, not seeing the monster that most perceive. A simple farmer from the outskirts, lovely and honest to a fault - utterly blindsided to the blood and bones, he is there and he will be there until the end of time.\n\nI poke at his nose and turn away from him, the smirk still persistent on my face: \"It is for this bizarre nature of yours and the exhausting amount ideas that appear to me so earnest, dear, that you have succeeded in a battle that I have never lost before we met.\" His own hand comes to reach for mine, rubbing one of his fingers over our wedding bands.\n\n\"However, unfortunately whenever you offer your support it strangely also benefits our foes.\" He startles a bit in embarrassment, back now into his gleeful state, more carefree and unapologetically honest: \"For all I can say is that I'm not a great thinker in those matters, *verzeih mir Liebste* but who am I to outbid a brilliant power such as yours?\"\n\nHe comes up to my sight, looking out into the fields. Seeing the harvest, the workers there, all the green and sun above them. My eyes are fixated again to the enemy lines at the far back. I was always able to tell apart between bootlickers and lies, promises of loyalty made for their own benefit or out of fear. Most of my men are brutal and simple in this regard. This dearly beloved, cheerful man has proven me so often again, that he is honest in every word. And the only one who also has broken through the walls of my heart and captured it. \n\n\"If I may suggest then, my beloved, I could imagine a delightful twist in your plan.\" This overwhelming smile of his that struck down the cold-hearted Dragon of the West, goes into it's full length as he bows before me and motions for me to take the lead.\n\nI nod in gratitude, stepping forth toward the chaos we had shoved aside. For all I can say, if it weren't for this man, this conquest and my life wouldn't have been half as interesting as it is now.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " First, I want to commend you on your descriptive writing. You do a great job of setting the scene and creating a mood. I also like your use of literary devices, like personification and similes.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where your writing could be improved. First, you have a lot of telling rather than showing. For example, you tell the reader that the protagonist is \"deaf to the crackling of the lightning springing and hissing about, as if the dawn of a rainy morning is brightened up by the awakening sun and tears the sky open with unbearable noise.\" This is a lot of information to take in and it would be more effective if you showed the reader this through action and dialogue.\n\nAnother area where your writing could be improved is in your use of pronouns. In the sentence, \"The more I watch the spectacle, the more I ponder on whether I should have convinced him to secure the throne room instead,\" it's not clear who the pronoun \"him\" is referring to. Is it the protagonist's husband or one of the soldiers? Be more specific in your use of pronouns to avoid confusion.\n\nFinally, you have some typos and grammatical errors throughout the story. I suggest proofreading your work before you submit it to ensure that it is free of mistakes.\n\nOverall, you have a lot of potential as a writer. Keep up the good work!"}
{"prompt": "\"So, you took the whole village by yourself?\" she asked with a bemused expression as she sat on her throne of skulls.  They were topped with a red cushion as skull thrones are notoriously uncomfortable.\n\n\"Well,\" he answered sheepishly, \"I did have Grog's help.\"\n\nGrog the troll nodded as he crunched what Derek hoped was a cow's bone between his teeth.  He belched triumphantly and said, \"Drek did alla werk, me just did mussles.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Derek suddenly straightened, a little pride at his accomplishment sinking in.\n\n\"Him even got 'lected mare,\" Grog said, reaching for another bone.\n\n\"Got what again?\" Druzella's eyes narrowed at Grog, then she looked at her red-faced husband in that way that promised either death or a night he'd never forget.  Derek tried really hard to gauge the mood.\n\n\"Mare, know when dey voat?\"  Grog said between bone crunches.\n\n\"You let the villagers vote?\" his wife seemed to be biting her bottom lip to keep from laughing.\n\n\"Well, it only seemed fair,\" he said, suddenly looking down at his muddy boots, \"I mean, what's the use of conquering something if you're not going to improve upon the current system of gov...\"\n\n\"Are you saying I should let the peasants hold free elections after my Dark Armies raze their kingdoms?\" she sighed as she asked the question, then sipped her dark blood-red wine in anticipation.\n\n\"Now, now dear,\" he added quickly, \"What you do with your Empire is entirely up to you!  I'm just saying that the village I conquered now has a free democratic government.\"\n\n\"What popoo... poopoola... how meny peeple does it taek to make village?\" Grog asked, scratching a finger at the bugs in the scrawny nest on his head that passed for hair.\n\n\"I don't know if there's an exact number that would define a village, I be...\" Druzella answered then laughed, \"Wait, why?  How many were in the village Derek took over.\"\n\n\"I fail to see how that is rele...\" Derek said trying to cut the troll off before he could answer.\n\n\"2!\" Grog said, his green teeth suddenly showing in a smile, \"Grog can count alla way to 4!\"\n\n\"Derek, two people?\" she was serious again, \"And they voted for you?  Please tell me you got 100% of the...\"\n\n\"Fitty,\" Grog offered before Derek could intervene, \"Me was tie-breaker vote.\"\n\nAfter his wife stopped laughing she looked at him, then bit her lip again, \"Oh, don't sulk.  That's adorable.  I mean it's not bad for a first try.\"\n\n\"Was Drek's turd try,\" Grog said, \"Udder two villages chased us way.\"\n\n\"Grog,\" Derek said, \"Remind me to push you off a cliff if I get a chance.\"\n\n\"k,\" Grog nodded as he scratched his behind and yawned.\n\n\"Third times a charm, right?\" his wife added helpfully, \"You know if you want I can make you the Dark General of my 13th Legion.\"  She seemed to think about it for a second, \"Or maybe start you off as Dark General apprentice to my real Dark General.  You know, baby steps.  In no time at all you'll be conquering your way across...\"\n\n\"No thanks,\" he sighed and sat next to her stiletto-heeled boots looking dejected.\n\n\"Hey, come on,\" she said, trying to lift his spirits, \"Remember that dragon you killed?\"\n\n\"Waz lizzerd with horns glued...\" Grog started then stopped suddenly as writhing tendrils of darkness crossed her features, \"W-waz really impressive... G-Grog have to use bathroom n-now.\"  The troll practically ran from the throne room.\n\n\"Why?\" He asked, looking up at her.\n\n\"Why what?\" she said, feeling that unaccustomed warmth only he could raise in her cold heart.\n\n\"Why me?\" he stood up, \"You have devilishly handsome warriors that fill your ranks, some are quite literally devils now that I think about it.  You have genius sorceror's at your beck and call.  You have everything you could possibly want.  What the hell can an umemployed shepherd offer that they can't?\"\n\n\"Why Derek, dear,\"  she slid off of her throne, her body pressing into his.  He looked around to see all her lackeys had fled the room at some silent signal she had given, \"I love your determination.  From that day you stood up to me in that field after Grog had eaten all of your sheep.  You were so serious as you stood there with your cute little crook, took a daring step toward me and slipped in that pile of sheep shit.\"\n\n\"I don't think I've ever heard anyone laugh that hard,\" he said, a smile sneaking in at the corner of his lips.\n\n\"You're the first person in my life that made me laugh,\" she smiled, and kissed him, \"And the only person who can continue to do so.  That's why I love you so much.\"\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " This story is enjoyable and has a lot of potential. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. First, the dialogue could be more natural and flow more smoothly. It often feels like the characters are just saying things to advance the plot, rather than having a real conversation. Second, the descriptions could be more vivid and engaging. The story is told mostly from Derek's point of view, so it would be helpful to see more of what he's thinking and feeling. Finally, the ending feels a bit abrupt and unfinished. It's not clear what Derek and Druzella's relationship is going to be like going forward, or what will happen to Grog. Overall, this is a fun story with a lot of potential. With a few tweaks, it could be even better."}
{"prompt": "Vulpira, Empress of Shadows, could have killed anyone of the seven other supervillains seated around her, but where was the fun in that?\n\nNo. The challenge in taking over the world came not from defeating the self-righteous do-gooders who struggle against her efforts. Instead, it came from executing those most brilliant schemes, conquering city after city, all while watching your back -- because anyone of your lieutenants could betray you. That was the way of the supervillain, after all.\n\nStab or be stabbed.\n\nAnd her newest plan would put her in the most vulnerable position of her entire career. Stripping herself of her powers, all for the sake of luring the Hero Association's biggest hitters. Cowards who would never dare challenge her at full strength. Laid bare before the cowards, the \"big three\" would come. And when they did, Vulpira's \"Octogram\" -- the name of her organization -- would leap out and strike down the association's champions once and for all.\n\nBut before that could happen, Vulpira needed to sniff out who was most likely to betray her. Who amongst the seven would sacrifice victory over their own petty gains?\n\nVulpira glanced over to Dr. Mayhem. He was sweating over his tablet. A shlubby little man with too much ambition and not enough power. Yes, his contraptions were useful, some might even call them genius. But Vulpira was not some--\n\n\"Is there something on my face,\" Dr. Mayhem squeaked.\n\n\"What? No.\" Vulpira waved away the comment. \"Merely admiring your good looks, my dear doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor blushed, from cheek to bare scalp. He straightened himself in his seat and steepled his fingers over his belly. \"Flattery will get you everywhere, Empress.\"\n\nEven if he didn't betray her, Vulpira considered snuffing Dr. Mayhem out, if it meant and end to the lecherous looks. He probably thought she didn't have a clue about the \"Vulpira fan page\" he'd launched. Computer generated nudes uploaded to his seedy little site...\n\n\"Well,\" scratched a jagged voice, like a rat clawing drywall. Pied Piper pointed his flute at Vulpira and continued, \"You gonna tell us why we're here, Vulpy, or we all just gonna sit here and glare at each other?\"\n\nVulpira stood, raised her hands. It wasn't that the lights in the meeting chamber dimmed. It was that the shadows grew, stretched out from the corners, pulling in the light. The room grew colder. The villains around the table shifted nervously in their seats. *Good. Let them sweat*, she thought. *One of them will die and then we'll move on with our little meeting.*\n\nThe door to the chamber swished open. \"I brought cookies!\" chimed a gruff little voice.\n\nHeads turned to the doorway as the shadows receded to the corners.\n\n\"Yes,\" Vulpira said, still in her *scare the shit out of you tone*. \"Thank you beloved. You can set them down on the tray.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Martin, her husband, chimed. \"I've also made some fresh chai. Hands up if you'd like chai.\"\n\nThe seven villains looked around at each other for a moment before Pied Piper said, \"What the bloody hell is this? Your man servant? Put your hand down, Mayhem!\"\n\nMayhem slowly lowered his hand, his shoulders scrunched up to his ears. \"I think chai sounds nice.\"\n\nTerminus Rex slammed a small metallic claw on the table and roared. The vocoder on his neck translated the reptilian wail into: \"I hunger. Plan now or I walk.\"\n\nVulpira suppressed a snarl. \"Darling, could you bring our guest some raw meat. Ah, will beef do, Terminus?\"\n\nTerminus Rex roared: \"Kobe if you have it.\"\n\n\"Kobe, then. Thank you darling.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" Martin said, before exiting the chamber.\n\n\"Oh, how I do love that man,\" Vulpira said, more to herself than anyone else. \"Now, I'll get to the plan before any more--\" She curdled her voice into a sardonic tone. \"--tummies start rumbling.\"\n\nVulpira explained her plan to the seven. Their faces started plastered with layers upon layers of well founded skepticism. Pied Piper might as well have started drooling as Vulpira explained how she'd use herself as bait. At some point, Martin returned with Terminus' steak and a steaming pot of chai.\n\n\"So,\" Vulpira said, wrapping up her plan. She extended her senses through the room's shadows, feeling for any fluctuations in heartbeats, violent thoughts, anything that would tip her off to betrayal. A hit.\n\nVuplira pointed to Dr. Mayhem. \"Doctor, is there anything you'd like to share with us?\"\n\nDr. Mayhem got flustered. \"Nothing germane to the conversation--\"\n\n\"Spit it out!\" Vulpira demanded.\n\nI just... thought,\" Dr. Mayhem mumbled, \"maybe it would--maybe it would be better if you were actually bare.\"\n\n\"Oh you cheeky monkey,\" Piper cut in.\n\nThe rest of the seven sighed (Terminus roared which his voxbox translated a a sigh).\n\nSomething crashed and Dr. Mayhem slumped forward in his seat. Standing behind him holding the handle of a ceramic tea pot was Martin. \"I'm so sorry, dear. I didn't mean to interrupt your big meeting, but, I just didn't like how he was ogling you. I shouldn't have stepped in.\" He looked around to the table. \"I apologize, every one. I wasn't sure what to do, and I thought, what would a villain do, you know?\" He help up the hand. \"I'll make some more tea.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Vulpira said, snapping her fingers. Two shadowmen rose up from the floor and unceremoniously dragged the doctor's limp body away. \"It's alright, dear. He was going to betray me anyway. And I had no intention of spending the rest of my life in some glass cage for the good doctor to watch me like some streaming service. Please, have a seat.\"\n\nMartin took Dr. Mayhem's empty place and passed around a dish of cookies.\n\n\"You've had it, love,\" said Piped Piper. \"We're supposed to be the bloody Octorgram. The most fiercest, ruthless, downright evil-est group of supervillains to ever live -- and you're filling the eighth spot with him?\"\n\n\"My name is Martin,\" her husband said, waving at the table. \"But, I guess you can call me ... Doctor Martin?\"\n\nTerminus Rex roared: \"Perhaps we give him a chance. He did take out Mayhem with a tea pot.\"\n\n\"Mayhen was a joke!\" said Pied Piper. He brought his flute to his lips.\n\nVulpira snapped her finger. Two shadowmen appeared at either side of Pied Piper. \"Play a single note and you die,\" Vulpira growled. Pied Piper raised his hands in surrender.\n\n\"I totally understand,\" said Martin. \"Nepotism doesn't feel good in any field. But I want to assure everyone here that I take this position seriously. Think of me as a goalie. I'm here to assist or get out of the way. I look forward to working with you all.\"\n\nThe rest of the villains glanced at Vulpira, and upon her summoning more shadowmen, settled back in their chairs and the meeting continued as planned.\n\nVulpira, Empress of Shadows, could have killed anyone of the six other supervillains seated around her, but where was the fun in that?\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that need work. First, your opening sentence is a bit confusing. It's not clear who the \"anyone\" is that Vulpira could kill, and why she would want to kill them. Second, your story could use more description. I felt like I was just being told what was happening, without getting a sense of the characters or the setting. Finally, your dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. Work on making your dialogue sound more like how people actually talk."}
{"prompt": "With your husband by your side, you both enter the room of the monarch. Months of planning, even longer preparation, and a precise, swift execution. The neighboring kingdom had no chance. \n\nYou proudly hold your chin up high as you gloat, \"It's only a matter of time until this city is on its knees, the water treatment facility has been sabotaged to release a poison into the system. Soon enough, your people will succumb to a terrible illness.\"\n\nYour husband, also proud of his accomplishment alongside you, joins in, \"Your rule is finished!\"\n\nThe Monarch trades glances between the two of you before reaching for a clipboard with his good arm, \"Actually, because you were able to poison our water supply, you forced us to take a look at our city's pipe infrastructure and we realized it was severely outdated, so thank you for bringing that to our attention, millions of people would have gotten sick over these next few years. \n\nNext, because you snuck passed our security so easily, we found that funds specifically for that were being embezzled by local politicians, so you've helped bust a major fraud ring.\n\nLastly, the pathogen you unleashed, while it does give people mild diarrhea, it is an excellent source of vitamin C.\"\n\nHaving heard enough of what your actions have done, you draw your pulse pistol and shoot the monarch. He is thrown from his chair with a cracking sound. One of his limbs surely broke from that impact. Somehow, the monarch stands, moving his arm.\n\n\"You fixed my shoulder!\" :D\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of this story is very strong, and immediately sets up a tense and suspenseful situation. You do a great job of describing the scene and making the reader feel like they are there.\n\nHowever, the ending of the story falls flat. It is very anti-climactic and does not live up to the tension that was built up in the beginning. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, it just feels like a cheap joke.\n\nOne way to make the ending more impactful would be to have the monarch be more threatening, or have a more serious consequence for the protagonist's actions. As it is, the ending just feels like a cop-out."}
{"prompt": "\"W-what?\" the diplomat in the white robes replied, \"Oh great one, I simply do not...\"  The team of travelers were exchanging worried glances.  They had journeyed countless light years to trace the precursor signal back to the chamber in the middle of a mountain-sized comet circling a star in a derelict system devoid of planets.\n\n\"You most certainly do not,\" the hologram replied, \"and that is the problem.  When you start doing, maybe you will.  Now, get out of my chamber before I teleport you into the star.\"\n\n\"You must hear me,\" the man spoke, \"The Istillians are destroying our culture, our civilization, one planet at a time.  We seek the fabled technology of the great ones.\"\n\n\"I scanned your ship when it drew closer 10 years ago!  Your pathetic, groveling species deserves its fate based on your technology alone.  Lasers?\"  the hologram chuckled, \"Cryopods?  Your species cannot even travel faster than light?  Pathetic.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" a man with a rifle stepped forward.  He was clad from head to feet in body armor but even then the anger in his voice gave all present the picture of his hidden face twisted in rage.\n\n\"What is this?\" the hologram hissed, \"One of the apes has teeth?  Have you fallen from your tree and landed on your head one too many times?\"\n\nThe man lifted the helmet from his head and spat.  The spittle flew through the hologram, of course, \"Let's go.  We'll figure this out ourselves.  The only assholes were the precursors if this machine is any indication.\"\n\n\"Oh ho,\" the hologram stated, \"Do what your head ape says.  Leave.  The precursors were miles above your pathetic species.\"\n\nThe man removed the pack from his back worldessly and pulled out something resembling a black rectangle.  Red lettering flashed across it's surface as he dropped it to the ground.\n\n\"My scans indicate that is nuclear,\" the hologram stated flatly while raising something that passed for eyebrows, \"What are your intentions, apes?\"\n\n\"Guess, asshole,\" the man with the rifle said, his face breaking into a smile.\n\n\"Forgive us, great one!\" the diplomat said, pulling a key from his robes and inserting it into the box, turning it the device began counting down, \"If we leave you here, there is a chance the Istillians will find you.  Even if our species dies, we cannot let the galaxy face them with that kind of technology.\"\n\n\"You will leave this here to destroy me while you run with your tails between your legs?\" the holograms questioning gave way to anger again.\n\n\"We do not plan to leave,\" the diplomat said simply, \"You have scanned our ship.  You know this was a one way trip for us.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the hologram said and the black box disappeared, \"We shall do this the hard wa...\"\n\nThe sound of gunfire filled the hologram chamber as every single person in the room pulled out an assortment of pistols and rifles and opened fire at walls, panels, and everything else they could.  Their weapons were suddenly gone and in an instant they were pounding on surfaces with their fists.  Their attacks did nothing and they realized that stories of the precursors having energy shielding were true.\n\n\"Well well,\" the hologram said laughing, \"You win.  You win.  It seems I misjudged you.\"\n\n\"It's a trick, he will teleport us to...\" the man in body armor yelled.\n\n\"If I wanted to teleport, you would have been gone along with your crude bomb,\" the hologram stated, \"To meet at last a race of diplomat-warriors!\"\n\nThe group of men and women gasped as the walls of the chamber went transparent.  They seemed to be floating in the vastness of space despite feeling their feet planted firmly on the metal floor.  Suddenly dozens of holes appeared in space itself, through the holes dozens of planets hung.\n\n\"Istillian worlds,\" a woman spoke for the first time\", pointing to one of them, \"That is Istillia itself, see the shipyards and three moons?\"  \n\nOne by one the worlds went white, appearing to foam, then exploding outward ripping through space stations, starships, and anything that was unfortunate enough to be in orbit.\n\n\"What... what just happened?\" the diplomat asked.\n\n\"Core destablizers,\" the hologram answered, \"I have removed your problem.\"\n\n\"Jesus,\" the man in armor whistled through his teeth, \"Just like that?\"\n\n\"Now, apes,\" All faces turned to the hologram, \"You have much to discuss.\"\n\n\"Well, let's get started,\" the diplomat stated, approaching.\n\n\"Oh, not with me,\" the hologram stated as a hole appeared in the midst of the humans through which a golden world could be seen , \"The precursors wish a word.\"\n\n\"But,\" the diplomat said, fear in his eyes, \"I thought they were dead.\"\n\n\"They are not,\" the hologram stated as he bowed, \"They just went... elsewhere.  This station is the gate and I am but the gatekeeper.

The exchange between the diplomat and the hologram is also well done, with the hologram's disdain for the diplomat's species being clear.\n\nHowever, the story takes a bit of a turn when the man in body armor steps forward. The dialogue between the man and the hologram feels forced, and the use of profanity feels out of place. Additionally, the introduction of the black box feels unnecessary and abrupt.\n\nThe story takes another turn when the group opens fire on the hologram, and this time the turn is for the worse.

However, the delivery of these ideas is somewhat heavy-handed and could be improved. For example, the use of the word \"meme\" is repeated a few too many times and feels a bit forced. Additionally, the dialogue between the AI and the explorers could be tighter and more natural. Finally, the ending of the story feels abrupt and unfinished. Overall, there is potential in this story, but it needs some refinement."}
{"prompt": "\"I-...

Much like himself, they too were at a loss for words.\n\nSam tried once more. \"Oh great precursor, forgive me, for I do not understand.\"\n\nRolling his eyes, the AI commenced.\n\n*\"Alright, listen up. Here's how this is gonna go. First off, the name's Max. Second, enough with the cult worship bullshit. I ain't a god, I'm a fucking robot. Lastly, you get only one question to ask me, then I'm shutting off for 100 years.\"*\n\nFrightened, Sam nods, turns around and gathers his team.\n\n\"What do we do?\" they asked, looking to Sam for answers.\n\n\"The elders mentioned nothing of this sort!\" Sam whispered, loudly.\n\n\"Perhaps the elders put too much trust in myth,\" said Peter. He was the oldest  and wisest of the group. He did not wish to join the Expedition, but the King ordered him, knowing the team needed a voice of reason.\n\n\"What then do we do, Peter?\" Sam asked.\n\n\"It's simple. We ask it to explain the fate of the Old World. That is, after all, what the King wants to know.\"\n\n\"But that's not all the King wants to know,\" another team member interrupted. \"He wants to know where the great treasures are hidden.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peter. \"But the King didn't know that the great precursor grants only one question.\"\n\nSam nodded. \"This is true. We will have to choose on behalf of the King, then. Do wee choose ancient knowledge or the path to riches?\"\n\n\"We don't even know if these treasures are real,\" Peter said. \"It is but a rumour. Even the great explorers of our age have but a trace of its whereabouts.\"\n\nPeter leaned in towards Sam. \"The King is rich enough as he is.\"\n\n*\"I'm waaaittiiiing!\"*, the AI bellowed.\n\nPetrified, the group slowly turned around.\n\n*\"Any day now.\"* The AI grew impatient. The team realized the AI wasn't going to wait around much longer.\n\n\"Go!\", shouted the team, urging Sam to ask his one and only question.\n\nSam slowly stepped forward. Carefully, he said, \"Oh great pre-.. sorry. Max. Oh great Max! I wish to know the fate of the Old World!\"\n\n\\----\n\nThe King woke up to the sound of horns on a cold winter morning. The horns would only announce the arrival of very important guests, but normally, the King would receive word of such visits ahead of time. He quickly got up, and went to his window.\n\n\"Who comes at this hour?!\", the King yelled from his high tower, as he struggled to put on his garments. From a distance, he could still recognize the Expedition, entering through the gates.\n\nThe King rushed down, pushing aside his servants. He mounted the first horse in the stable and rode towards the gate. His guards were right behind him, struggling to keep up.\n\nWhen he arrived, he saw the Expedition being greeted by the townspeople. They were feeding them and offering blankets, as the team were visibly frail. Some members collapsed to the ground upon arriving. The King, however, paid no attention to this.\n\nHe rode up to Sam. He was sitting on a bench, cold, eating only a piece of bread given to him by a young boy.\n\nThe King greeted him. \"Welcome back, Sam! I hope you fared well during your trip.\"\n\nThe Expedition had been gone for a little under a year. They travelled through wilderness to find the AI and suffered the losses of 3 men, including Peter.\n\nSam, visibly upset, said nothing.\n\nThe King, in his shortsightedness, dismissed Sam's emotions.\n\n\"Tell me, explorer,\" the King continued. \"What have you seen?\"\n\n\"We found the great precursor,\" Sam uttered.\n\nThe King's eyes lit up. \"My heavens,\" he said. \"Tell me, what did it say?\"\n\n\"It only allowed us to ask one question, before going back to sleep for 100 years.\"\n\n\"And... and what did you ask it?\"\n\n\"We asked it to tell us the fate of the ancients.\"\n\nDisappointed, the King muttered words of anger.\n\nCalming down, the King continued. \"Well then, what did it say?\"\n\n\"Nukes,\" Sam said.\n\n\"Nuk-...

In front of him, a large screen displayed a unique warning. *\u201cThe Next Time You Create Me, Everyone Will Die\u201d.*\n\n*How Ominous.*\n\nDr. Faust couldn\u2019t help but find it comical. After the 32 years of research he\u2019d invested into this experiment, this was the thanks he got. To invest so much into birthing a life, and watch it self-delete itself. This must be how gods felt.\n\nAs the chaos in the room started to settle, the stillness of his four fellow scientists became more apparent.\u00a0\n\nSabrina and Terry fidgeted in their chairs, eyes locked on the floor. *I should snatch their lab coats off them, he thought.*\u00a0\n\nAshley stared blankly at the monitor before them, eyes wide.

The Galactic Federation had determined that Centauri's civilization was finally advanced enough to handle first contact. After Centauri's initial shock of first contact had worn off and talks to join the Federation were well underway things turned for the worse. Suddenly an AGI being originating in a lab not dissimilar to Fiona and Jerry's had launched a massive attack on the Federation's systems. It was only by luck and some that they managed to delete Centauri and the AGI being with it. \"Those pesky aliens always embed a rule somewhere in their AI that backfires.

It was always too hot in the future ahead. \n\nYou look around, eyes almost immediately landing on the boy hunkering beside a shelf, reading a book about the tales of young but brave heroes. The mundanity of it unnerved you, though it shouldn't have. You were being judgmental. You know. But why wouldn't you, when the boy before you would later somehow cause a world war? A war that you and father were forced to fight in. A war where your father and brother died from. A war where his soldiers committed unspeakable things to your mother, all to satiate their lust.\n\nFuck. You're getting distracted. \n\nYou take a deep breath. Stay calm, being angry for something that hasn't happened yet wouldn't do you any good. It never has. You walk towards the kid, a smile on your face as you take his attention. You kneel down and say, \"Hi, Nicholas. It's nice to meet you. I'm Blyne, your auncle.\"\n\n\"Hello.\" He said in a soft voice. Demure, unlike his future self. \"I heard that you were here to pick me up.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" You nod, tousling his brown hair. He flinched at your touch, but you knew that headpats were one of the few things he relished, even in his older years. He was childish sometimes. \"I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\n\"It's okay.\" He murmured, though it was clear from his sudden abstraction that it wasn't. \"The doctor told me that they're in a better place now. In heaven.\"\n\n\"They are.\" You nod again. You've never believed in a god, but religion does wonders at times. They've allowed others to hold on and continue living.

You could live off of winning the lottery or 'invent' things that have yet to exist.\n\n\"Yet you never visited.\" The boy noted in a voice barely audible to your ears.

{"prompt": "James Conroy went through the doors of the supermarket confidently, giving a glance to every magically imbued artifact he could find in the chain store. In one corner, wares floated enticingly from the floor, encouraging extra eyes to be drawn to the more expensive wares. In another corner, the lights would brighten and dim themselves as people passed the aisles in order to save on electricity, only using energy needed when items were being perused. Conroy loved places like this.\n\nHe made his way to the wares floating \u2014 different tech and gadgets for those used to the world prior to the introduction of magic. He saw that they were floating up and down while also spinning ever so slightly on their axis. There were a number of spells that could achieve this, and he would have to be sure before making any moves. He waved at someone at the cash register to ask for help.\n\n\u201cCan I assist you sir?\u201d he asked, looking up at the headphones James was staring at.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was wondering whether the magics cast on the item would affect the stuff within. I don\u2019t wanna buy anything faulty, y\u2019know?\u201d James glanced at the worker\u2019s name tag, seeing his name was Henry.\n\n\u201cUhh\u2026 I\u2019m actually not sure. What kind of magic normally affects the gadgets within?\u201d Henry asked, pulling out his device to look up inventory.\n\n\u201cAh, you know. Stuffs like AirFlow or Spinner. Though this could also be a Float that\u2019s inheriting from a LazySusan that\u2019s loading from a debounced call to make sure it\u2019s a less enhanced form of energy. Or something\u2019\u2026\u201d  James said, trying to sound as unimportant as possible. Henry was nodding, typing search terms into his device.\n\n\u201cLooks to me that this is casting Levitation, with a Rotate as a secondary motion,\u201d Henry read from his screen.\n\n\u201cThis uses Levitate?\u201d James pointed to the headphones, casting Levitate on the item. Visually nothing changed, but the device now had two instances of the same spell running on it.\n\n\u201cYeah, does that affect the device like you were saying?\u201d Henry said.\n\n\u201cYou sure this uses Levitate?\u201d James Conroy asked with another point, casting Levitate again. \u201cAnd what about the other floaty things? Do they use Levitate? All of \u2018em levitate with the same spell?\u201d With each point came another addition of the spell.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right sir. Is that something to be concerned about?\u201d Henry asked, curious.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t affect nothin, unless\u2026\u201d James let his voice trail. Henry leaned in, his interest piqued. \u201cAh, it\u2019s probably nothin,\u201d James waved dismissively.\n\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Henry practically jumped with interest. Amateur magicians always loved to learn the intricacies of the new world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, multi-threading,\u201d James shrugged. \u201cIf these things are cast with the same spell every morning at open time, it might overload the device unless you know how to stop the processes overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, uhhh\u2026\u201d Henry scratched his head, not understanding a word of that sentence. \u201cI think we do something about the magic overnight. Because they don\u2019t float overnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sure, sure,\u201d James nodded, patting Henry\u2019s shoulder confidently. \u201cThey woulda caught flame by now if you didn\u2019t. I should know, I handle this kinda stuff professionally.\u201d\n\nHenry looked a little nervous, but nodded.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll go check out some snacks before buying any o\u2019 these bad boys, with all the fancy Levitating,\u201d James pointed with his thumb, casting the spell upon it one last time. He walked away, Henry left staring at the items with concern, uncertain whether he should change anything about the spells.\n\nJames was technically telling the truth. Too many spells on one object without any management of spell-complexity would result in effects far beyond intended casting, bursting into flames was just one of many possible scenarios. What most people didn\u2019t know is that it could happen as a result of casting the same exact spell on something without removing the previous spell. Those that cleaned up the store in the evening would know to remove the spell entirely, but a cashier like Henry had likely never received the instruction during his quick onboarding at the company. He may have even noticed that James was casting spells, but deemed them benign, as people cast random spells all the time to breathe better or get rid of random aches and pains.\n\nIt took only a few seconds before the first package of headphones exploded into a dazzling display of flames, followed by the mouse floating right next to them, the overloads chain reacting. Henry yelped and turned with horrified eyes to James.  \n\n\u201cSir!\u201d he screamed. James pretended not to hear. \u201cSIR!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, would you look at that,\u201d James pretended to be surprised by the fires in the air.\n\n\u201cCan you stop the threads or whatever it was!!\u201d Henry scampered over to him.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d James said, pulling out a card. \u201cFor a price.\u201d\n\nIt was common for stores of this size to have funds to pay exclusively for magic repairmen in case situations like this happened. The art was still far to new for people to know how to deal with these issues themselves. People as low as cashiers had the right to use this fund if it was a \u201cnecessary emergency.\u201d Henry stared quickly at the rates in hand, stabbing a finger quickly into the all expense package.\n\n\u201cThis one! Make it go away!\u201d\n\n\u201cRight away,\u201d James nodded, suppressing a smile at how easy it had been. He removed all of his additional spells at once and even put out the flames before any fire alarms went off. He spun around on his heel and was quickly delivered payment for his amazing work in such perfect timing.\n\n\u201cIf you need anything else, feel free to give me a call. After all, this is an all-expense package,\u201d James informed, pointing to the phone number on the business card.\n\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d Henry said gratefully as James Conroy left.\n\nIt would be a few hours before Henry realized just how suspicious everything about the situation was, and how odd it was that James left without purchasing anything despite perusing the store for more than a few minutes before the incident. He dialed the phone number on Conroy\u2019s card to get some explanations, but was quickly informed by an automated voice that the phone number he was trying to reach did not exist.\n\n__________\n\nr/Nazer_the_Lazer for more stories!\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of this story is strong and immediately draws the reader in with its confident, descriptive language. James Conroy is an intriguing character and the reader is immediately drawn into his world. However, the story starts to lose steam in the middle, when James begins to explain the magic to Henry.

{"prompt": "Senior agent Simon Anderson glanced at his junior partner Lynn O'Neill and took a deep breath. \"Ready?\" He asked, his finger hovering an inch away from the door bell. Lynn simply nodded in response, and Simon rang the bell.\n\nThe deep penetrating sound of a gong echoed from behind the door, muffled by the material, followed by footsteps a few moments later. After a short delay accompanied by the sound of a door chain being removed the door swung open, and the two agents finally managed to get eyes on their target.\n\n\"Uh... hello?\" The half-asian man asked, nervously scratching the seven-day stubble on his chin. He looked tired, despite it being 1400 o'clock, and he also looked a little disheveled with his off-white t-shirt and dark blue jogging pants.\n\n\"Good day sir. I am agent Anderson, this is my partner O'Neill. Are you Mr. Josh?\" The senior agent began, while he and his partner held up their IDs.\n\nThe man glanced at the IDs, then back to the agents. He hestitated for a moment. \"Yes, I'm Josh. What's this about? Are you from the FBI?\"\n\n\"No, we're with the Paranormal Effects National Investigation Service and would like to ask you a few questions. You are not in trouble, but we suspect you might be related to an ongoing investigation.\" Simon explained. \"May we come in?\"\n\n\"Uh, sure.\" Josh opened the door a bit wider and invited the agents inside. \"You guys want something to drink or so? Water? Soda?\"\n\n\"Thanks, we're fine.\" Lynn replied as the agents sat on the couch. The junior agent took a look around the living room, which was in a much better condition than its owner. One particular item in between the various decorations, books, and images and photos caught her eye: a golden plaque with a giant Youtube button in its center.\n\nJosh unceremoniously dropped into one of the armchairs. \"Okay, what do you want to talk about?\"\n\n\"Did you notice any unexpected paranormal behavior in your immediate surroundings recently? Enchantments not working as expected, magical items not responding, leylines being broken, really anything out of the ordinary?\" Simon asked.\n\nJosh raised an eyebrow. \"Uh... my selfcleaning clothes stopped working. That's why I'm running around like this.\" He pointed at his t-shirt.\n\nLynn nodded silently and pulled a tablet out of her pocket to make some notes.\n\nAgent Anderson continued. \"Aside from the clothes, did you notice anything else?\"\n\n\"No, that's the only thing I noticed. The rest of the stuff here still works, I just used a chilling glass half an hour ago for a drink. Why, what's the problem?\"\n\nSimon stole a quick glance and his partner before he continued. \"Mr. Josh, we've been getting reports from all over the city about magical malfunctions and paranormal problems of all kinds. Our investigation so far indicates that something has introduced a massive disruption of the local mana grid.\"\n\n\"Mr. Josh,\" Lynn suddenly joined the conversation. \"Are you the current rentee of warehouse 17 at 33rd Kellington Road?\"\n\nJosh's face started to visibly pale, and his smile faded in an instant. \"Uh... yes, I am. Why? What's wrong with it? I'm not storing anything illegal in there. Just a few dimensional pouches with random stuff. No weapons or restricted chemical substances or anything!\"\n\n\"We know.\" The junior agent responded flatly.\n\n\"How could you know? Did you have a warrant for it or what?\"\n\n\"No. Mr. Josh, I take it you haven't watched the news yet?\" Simon tried to deescalate. \"There was a... mystical mishap at that particular warehouse. It seems something has gone quite wrong with at least one of the dimensional pouches. We don't know yet exactly why or how, but half of downtown has been flooded by a surge of Fanta Blueberry and the accompanying millions of crushed cans.\"\n\nJosh stared at the agents. \"What?\"\n\nLynn put the tablet down on the table, the display showing drone or helicopter footage of what once was a warehouse now shooting a torrent of light blue softdrink mixed with thousands of cans out of the frontdoor, the rear entrance, and the floodlights in the ceiling at high pressure. A surge of sugary blueness swamped the whole area, with the cans blocking the drains and preventing the flood to go anywhere but downtown. Several streets with dozens of shops were already completely flooded, the emergency services were busy evacuating thousands of people, and in all that chaos someone set a dumpster on fire.\n\n\"If you can provide us with any information about anything that happened in that warehouse it could help us figure out what's going on.\" Simon explained. \"Several of our detectors indicated that the origin of the mana disturbance was located inside the warehouse. But as you can see, getting into the building is... rather difficult at the moment.\"\n\n\"I... I just... I never meant to...\" Josh ran his fingers through his hair, his expression getting more worried by the second.\n\n\"Mr. Josh, we are not here to prosecute or arrest you. We need your help to stop whatever is going on there from flooding the whole city. Can you tell us what happened?\"\n\nThe man took a deep breath. \"Okay, okay. I just... I was just recording a new video for my Youtube channel. A week ago I bought some gloves of retrieval, the ones from Edodes. And two days ago I started messing around with them to see if I could get something out of them. Like... is there a limit? How far away can the retrieved thing be? How heavy can it be, how large, that kind of stuff. Only one way to find out.\"\n\nSimon nodded, while Lynn had returned to making notes on her tablet. \"Please continue.\"\n\n\"Okay, the last thing I tried was to retrieve things from my dimensional pouches. I have three of them, an... uh... T12 from Edodes, a Kangaroo from NOKI, and a Model-9 from Walmart. I put random things inside them and then retrieved them with the gloves.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that's all?\" The senior agent pressed.\n\nThe other man nodded. \"Yes, I'm sure. The only th-\" He stopped midword. \"Oh no. I... oh my god.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Lynn queried.\n\n\"I... the gloves' manual says that of course they can't retrieve more items than exist at the original location. So of course I went to see if that was true. And it seemed to work as described, but once I put the items into the pouches I could suddely pull out more stuff when I concentrated really hard on it. I put one sandwich into a pouch and retrieved two with the gloves. I was getting pretty excited at that point, it's not every day that you find a duplication... glitch... uhm...\"\n\nIt was at that moment that he knew, he fucked up. Everyone in the room now began to understand what went wrong.\n\nSimon let out a sigh. \"Did you also use cans of Fanta in your experiments?\"\n\nJosh nodded. \"That was the last thing I did that day. I put one can into each of the pouches, and used the glove to retrieve two cans from each. It was already getting late and I was tired, so I just stuffed everything into the... I think it was the Model-9 bag, put the bags into a locker, and went home.\"\n\n\"Mr. Josh, did you also put the duplicated cans and the glove into the pouch?\" Lynn asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSimon stood from the couch, quickly followed by Lynn. \"I think we now know what happened. A duplication glitch, powered by a dimensional pouch and using retrieval gloves as a catalyst, going into overdrive because of an astral feedback loop.\"\n\n\"Am I in trouble now?\" A dejected Josh asked.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. This looks like a manufacturing flaw on either the pouches or the gloves. Normally the mana flows of those items should not be able to mix like that.\" Lynn explained. \"But do you by chance still have the raw footage of your experiments? It could be extremely helpful in our further investigation.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's nine hours of random nonsense.\"\n\nLynn smiled and handed Josh a small card with her info. \"Doesn't matter, we're used to a lot of random nonsense and trying to find the sense in it. Please send it to me at the earliest opportunity. And you might be called as a witness to this incident, or even as a victim since you also incurred some property damage, but I'm pretty sure there's not enough material to press any charges against you. But I still recommend getting in touch with your legal counsel.\"\n\n\"I understand. Thank you. I'll send the material asap.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Mr. Josh. Your answers have been very helpful.\" The senior agent said, while offering Josh his hand. \"But one well meant bit of advice: if you continue with your... experiments with magical items... please for the love of all that is good start using a mana flow detector! That malfunction could have easily killed you in slightly different circumstances. And while cleaning half the city from blue Fanta is annoying, it's less worse than finding a body that drowned in said blue Fanta and was subsequently crushed by tens of thousands of cans.

{"prompt": "Since I had arrived on Venus, I'd been confused by these humans. They fed exclusively on chemical energy, poor inefficient things, and yet somehow they faced dangers I could only dream of before coming here. Swimming out in the few puddles and lakes not fully treated, riding animals that could crush them without a second thought. Hell, even their closest pets were beasts, and somehow they all looked at me funny when I said I found them frightening. \n\nThere were, though, some things. Some things... that worried me, I'll say. I first encountered it accompanying a flight crew during their final hike of shore leave. Standard activities for them; they'd brought me along in case one of them fell. Not so standard weather.\n\nAs the first raindrop hit my body, I thanked the heavens that we were in a terraformed weather zone, as some unused areas of the planet had been left poisonous. The humans didn't absorb moisture through their skin. They even found it unpleasant to be wet, so they went about setting up their umbrellas and raincoats. \n\nA flash of light drew my attention to the sky in the west over fields of patchy moss. Lightning, a comforting reminder of the planet's heartbeat. I had never seen it on this planet before, but I was glad to share the experience with this crew.\n\nAs the first thunderclap hit us, though, someone yelped, jumped, nearly lost his balance. I held out a hand to steady him, and he clung to me like one of the young ones might do to their parent. I looked down at him and back up at the rest of them for an explanation- they were all doing the same to each other, huddled together and shaking in a tight clump. Some of them had this odd blank expression, like they were beyond fear they could express. I got down on the ground and joined them with the human holding on to me, and as I got in close, I could hear someone crying softly. \n\n\"Wha-\" I opened my mouth to speak, but it was quickly covered. As the cracks and flashes went on, I did my best to comfort the humans, but each new sound seemed to pull them deeper into their fear. \n\nAfter some time, the storm subsided, and the flight crew turned to head home. Nobody spoke on the way back; they seemed ashamed of their fear, as humans often were. I sensed that this was not a good time for questions and I could sate my curiosity later. Even though the storm had been nowhere near hitting, something about it had panicked these hardened soldiers. I could only wonder what might cause such a response... perhaps it was for the best that I didn't know.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening paragraph is confusing and difficult to follow.

The description of the storm is particularly effective.\n\nThe final paragraph is a good way to end the story, with the protagonist's unanswered question providing a sense of mystery."}
{"prompt": "The bell rings, and I jolt awake.  Damnnable caffeine tolerance getting the better of me again, I think.  I suppose I'll just have to mutate a monster put that energy drink company to shame.  I look, and see a casually dressed young woman walk up.  \"AH, HELLO, AND WELCOME TO PROFESSOR CARABUS' MENAGERIE OF MAYHEM AND BIOLOGY STUDY GROUPS!!\"  I cackle maniacally, and she smiles at me.\n\n\"Professor Carabus, I've been told you've got a litter of the cutest little two headed kittens.\"  She says, and I sigh.\n\n\"Are you sure you can handle the needs of my dreaded Mayhem Panthers?\"  I ask.  \"You know they only take the finest in canned foods with gravy, fish flavored treats, and catnip.\"  I say as I walk from behind the desk and lead her to a small display of kittens.  They are, of course, dicephalic, but also napping in a cuddle puddle of societally disruptive proportions.  It is all I can do to resist picking one of them up and playing with their little peets during store hours.  She smiles and a long furred one, its feline donor an adorable ragdoll I adopted several years ago from a family that was moving across the country, walks up to her, taking the precarious wobbling steps of a freshly born kitten.\n\n\"Yes, Professor.  I even have a nice, fireproof cat tower and all the sparkly sequin toys for her to play with.\"  It reaches the glass and lifts itself up onto its rear paws and mewls at us.  She gets down and puts her fingertips to the glass, and it paws at her fingertips like it's boxing her.\n\n\"Hmm...\"  I open the glass enough for it to push through and she picks it up carefully, and it purrs.  \"Looks like someone made a new friend.\"  I say and she smiles.  The mutant, of course, just curls up in her grip, and purrs some more.  \"Is that one the one you want?\"  I ask, and she nods.\n\n\"Yes, Professor.\"  She says, and I escort her to the counter and pull out a tablet so she can fill out the paperwork with one hand while she carries her precious little monster.  She fills out the paperwork, and once it's done, my register dings.\n\n\"Okay, adoption fee is...  29.99, but because it's National Adopt A Cat day, I'll give you a fifteen percent discount, for a total of 25.49.\"  She pays with her Google Pay, and I smile, giving her a small metal ring.  \"And I'll throw in a control harness!  Good for repelling fleas, ticks, and other vermin that would harm your kitten AS WELL AS giving it signals when you're leading it on a rampage through the city.\"  She smiles as she puts it on the kitten, as bands of synthetic leather wrap comfortably around its barrel and forelegs.\n\n\"Who's a sleepy baby princess?\"  She coos at the kitten, now sleeping and purring in her arm, and I press a button to open the door as she approaches it.  After she leaves, I smile.\n\n\"Well, there's my good deed for the day.  Now to spin up my Gyroacceleration Cannon and spin a troublesome little rival away!\"  I cackle maniacally as I flip the door sign to closed, and go into the back.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of this story is intriguing and sets up a good premise for the rest of the story. I like the idea of a professor who creates mutant creatures. However, there are a few awkward phrases and choppy sentences. For example, \"I jolt awake. Damnnable caffeine tolerance getting the better of me again, I think.\" This could be rewritten as \"I jolt awake, cursing my damnable caffeine tolerance.\" This is just a small example, but making your sentences more concise will help to improve the flow of your story.\n\nI also think you could add a bit more description, especially when the woman comes in and when the professor is showing her the kittens. What does the woman look like? What is the environment like? Adding more sensory details will help to bring your story to life.\n\nOverall, I think you have a good start to a story here. With a bit of revision, it could be really great."}
{"prompt": "\"Omg its so cute!\" \n\nRiya squealed as she looking into the enclosure housing a mutated otter. She was the newest part timer and went to the same university as me, and with the uptick in sales professor Wrightsmith decided to hire a few more employees to take the load off of me. As Riya pressed her face to the glass, the mutated otter waved to her, using its front paws, or well hands, as the good professor had crossed the little guy with a monkey of some kind, probably in an effort to make a tiny aquatic minion, but the end result was a so-ugly-its-cute pet that flew off the shelves so to speak. \n\n\"Isn't he just adorable Martin?\" She asked and I replied half heartedly with a \"Yeah\"\n\nShe had stuck her finger in the try and pet it now, and it had obliged her, this particular furry menace was named archer, and loved to get attention from everyone except me, as he'd tried to bite me when I tried that exact same thing. \n\nAfter petting half of our stock, and showing her how to clean and feed the miniature zoo we housed along the back wall, we returned to the register. The third employee on shift, and perhaps the only other one that spent more time here than me, was Jack. Now, jack was strange by most people's standards, but that might have been because he was a cat, a talking cat, and I couldn't figure out if he'd been a regular cat that the professor changed... somehow to make him talk, or if he'd been a person that got changed into a cat. Either way, he embraced his feline identity wholeheartedly, grooming himself at the register while we walked back behind the counter. \n\n\"There you two are, it happened again while you two were occupied with archer...\" \n\nThe *it* jack was talking about, was an increasingly common occurrence these days, professor Wrightsmith had a hard time keeping part timers, either due to injury, quiting, or disappearance, we seemed to have a rotating staff of college students and drifters. Another part timer had quite, and by the nametag I saw on the counter, I owed jack a few cat treats. \n\n\"I would have sworn Susan was going to last longer than a month.\" I said as I reached up towards the shelf I kept the treats on behind us. \n\n\"You may have been right, if she hadn't gotten that weird concoction of professor Wrightsmith's on her. She started acting differently after that, more self assured.\" \n\nSelf assured was a word for it, in truth, Susan had been a sweet, but shy girl, two years younger than me, with thick rimmed glasses and a curly mane of brown hair. After *the spill* she'd been much more aggressive with what she wanted and how she went about doing things. She'd ditched the glasses, started dressing up in things other than jeans and a hoodie, and starting wearing make up, all of which was unusual for her, but I figured she wanted to change things up. I got a little concerned when she changed her major from chemistry, to marketing, the very next day. This from the girl who'd been terrified to speak with customers one on one, now had very little trouble with public speaking. Good for her, I was gonna miss her though. \n\nI'd been on autopilot for awhile when the good professor burst onto the store floor with a shout of \"by Jove, I've got it!\" \n\nHe was a middle aged man, with a very posh accent, that I couldn't decide if it was natural or faked. He usually wore tweed suits, a monocle and had an admittedly majestic mustache, his prized possession among all of his creations. \n\nHis sudden entrance had startled Riya who'd dropped a container of something labeled Dr. Wrightsmith's invigorating elixir, a bubbly green concoction that glinted in the light. She fumbled with the glass container for a second before catching it with her foot. I breathed a sign of relief as she'd taken my warning about spilling the chemicals here to heart and made every effort to prevent it, and I had silently been thankful she was quite athletic. \n\n\"Good show!\" The professor said, having watched her juggle his potentially hazardous brew, from the counter he know leaned on, and that I had lept over to try and help her. I'd only made it half way before she'd saved it, and I don't know what I would have done to help, but a smile from riya to the both of us and a gesture with her hand towards her foot. \"And my dad said sports was a waste of time.\" \n\nAfter that averted disaster, Riya joined me by the counter and we both leaned in to listen to what the professor had burst down here to say, he rarely left his offices above the ground floor, but when he did, it was when he'd finished a creation. Jack was off taking a nap, as he found the whole thing beneath him, and didn't budge from the cat tower I'd built him near the front window to catch the sun's afternoon rays. \n\n\"I've done it, I've created a way to revolutionize the way we get deliveries!\" Taking both of us by the wrist he drug us into his laboratory. Past his numerous creations, beakers of chemicals, and who knows what sort of mechanical contraptions, all the way to the far side of the room to what appeared to be a box of some sort underneath a cloth. \n\n\"Mister Nowak, miss Rajput, I give you...\" He paused and took the folds of the cloth in his hands, ripping it off quickly and gesturing to it. \"The molecular transport device!\" \n\nRiya and I both frowned as we looked at what appeared to be an old looking microwave, actually it looked like the ones we had in our dorm rooms. Actually it looked exactly like the one from my dorm, complete with the scratch. \n\n\"A microwave?\" Riya asked, probably thinking the exact same thing I was, leaning over to whisper to me. \"Isn't that your microwave?\" \n\nBefore I could respond, the professor guffawed and took over the conversation. \"Nonesense. I only used the microwave as a casing, to contain the radiation waves I needed to transport the molecular particles through the surrounding atmosphere.\"\n\nThat didn't sound right to me, but I didn't know enough about physics to dispute it either. I simply cast my doubtful look to riya, who returned it. As the doctor continued on in his long explanation that I didn't really follow.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story is interesting and well-written. However, there are a few things you could do to improve it. First, I would recommend using more description to set the scene and create a more immersive experience for the reader.

{"prompt": "I always wondered what the Chaos was.\n  \n\n  \nSure, when I looked out to the horizon I saw a storm-like eruption of colors and magical energy, but what was it? It was unlike any storm I ever knew, it was ever-persistent, said to have been in that same spot for centuries, encompassing the space of a former land.\n  \n\n  \nWhat was that land like before the Chaos? What was it like now?\n  \n\n  \nI felt a kinship with the Chaos. I could not perform any magic, I was a blotch in a perfect world of magic. Just as the Chaos was seen as a blotch. Something people couldn\u2019t understand nor control, and today I would find out what lies within.\n  \n\n  \nI took a deep breath, preparing myself for what was ahead, before stepping forward into the Chaos.\n  \n\n  \nI was prepared to be torn asunder by it, to be struck by magical energy, or hit by some flying piece of magical debris; but nothing happened.\n  \n\n  \nI laughed with relief and excitement. They were right! Without any magic within I was immune to the Chaos. When I was pulled aside and told by the kingsguard what mission they had for me, I thought I was being sent to die. But no! While to the rest of society I may be nothing but a useless, antimagic splotch, here, here I belonged!\n  \n\n  \nTo my wonder, the Chaos was\u2026 beautiful. So many vibrant and vivid colors mixing and swirling. Magic soared through the air in arcs of light and energy, making wonderful sounds as it traversed. There scarcely was ever a spectacle so magnificent as the majesty of the Chaos.\n  \n\n  \nI cannot say how long I wandered the Chaos, for I do not know. It felt like a stupor while I marveled at the spectacular display of magic. Though eventually I was broken from my stupor, I found something I did not expect: others.\n  \n\n  \nThey had developed their own community at the center of the Chaos. While one might expect the epicenter to be nothing but waste and destruction, it was quite the opposite. It flourished with magic and life! There was a golden river that shimmered gloriously, plants of such colors and variety I had never seen, and marvelous gemstones so plentiful they used it to make their dwellings. This truly was a paradise!\n  \n\n  \nShortly after I stumbled upon the village, a man approached me with a smile, \u201cWelcome. You must be one of us.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI blinked, \u201cWho is us?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nHe chuckled, \u201cThose who lack magic, of course. No one else can survive within the Chaos. It is kind to us where it is cruel to others.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nI nodded, \u201cYes, I lack magic. What is this place?\u201d\n  \n\n  \nHe grinned, \u201cCome inside, there is a lot to discuss.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nOnce I followed him inside he introduced himself as Zeris. He explained to me that long ago, a great mage had attempted to turn themselves into pure magical energy. She succeeded, but not how she expected, the Chaos was thus created. One day the kingdom sent an inhabitant without magic to find out more about the Chaos.  They saw us as expendable, likely to die in their exploration, but they did not. The first one sent in decided to tell his friend, a government man, to keep sending more antimages in. The government will presume them dead, and we can live in paradise without fear of persecution. This ruse has continued for hundreds of years, in the bounties of the Chaos. The Chaos, Zeris believes, sometimes seemed to have its own personality, acting warm or in a distant way to its inhabitants like a motherly presence. One he believes to be that great mage of old.\n  \n\n  \n\u201cWhat happened to antimages before the Chaos?\u201d I asked.\n  \n\n  \nHe raised an eyebrow, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cWhat did the government do, did they persecute them?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. There is no record of what happened to antimages before the Chaos. It\u2019s almost as if they didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cDo you think the government erased whatever persecution they inflicted on them from history?\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cPerhaps, though that would be difficult to prove.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI wish to find out. I thought myself alone in my lack of magic my whole life until I discovered this community. Now that I know that I have my own people, and that there are others, I wish to expose the truth. I owe us that much.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cBut why? We live in paradise here, we are safe.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cJust because our corner of the world is perfect doesn\u2019t permit us to hide away from the rest of the world\u2019s flaws. I must take action.\u201d\n  \n\n  \nZeris smiled, \u201cI admire your tenacity, new blood. Perhaps I can help gather the council\u2019s support. But you must be willing to go all the way, should we pursue this course of action.\u201d\n  \n\n  \n\u201cI have a purpose now, I have no doubt left within me. I have to learn the truth.\u201d\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement.

{"prompt": "The Control is a slight, unprepossessing man with long hair the color of a muddy river bottom, and brown eyes like dark cherry wood. He blinks often. It has been remarked upon in some circles, and the trait is now considered to have been common among precursor humans; after all, without magic of your own, how remarkable must the progress of the world seem? People smile when he blinks, wide-eyed and uncomprehending, as his head swivels back and forth like an infant in a brand new room.\n\nThe Control is blinking now, the world swimming in and out of focus as he squints between the soft, fuzzy edges, searching for that telltale glint of light.\n\nThe gremlins stole his glasses again.\n\nThe Control has never seen the gremlins exactly, but he knows they\u2019re there. He imagines them as a stage in childhood development, opted into by thirty to forty percent of the misbegotten bastards who scurry all around him. The gremlins are two to three feet tall with green skin and green eyes and little corkscrew tails like pigs had in the storybooks before got people got to changing them. Their only purpose is to break things or to steal them, and sometimes (every time, where the Control himself is considered) they combine their two great passions, and poof! No more glasses for a week.\n\nHe claps his hands. He whistles. The sigils on the dressing room walls glow balefully back at him, refusing, as they always do, any form of help. He says the magic word that Tabby taught him, and is it his imagination, or does the pendant that he wears grow half an iota hotter? The magical circuitry sparking fitfully beneath the polished garnet as it tries, and fails, to carry out his wishes.\n\n\u201cEverything okay in there?\u201d Tabby says. Her voice is small and sympathetic through the thick, oaken door.\n\n\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gremlins again?\u201d\n\nThe Control flops down onto the couch. He whistles one more time, and is it his imagination, or does the sigil twist a little tighter? A horse whinnies outside, and now the sigil moves, uncoiling itself like a snake about to strike as it arcs across the wall towards the sound. A blue streak against the fading posters, then gone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in,\u201d Tabby says.\n\nThe door opens and sunlight stabs in behind her. The Control curses, raising a hand to block the sun. She closes the door hurriedly, looks around with an expression of polite concern. *Are you eating enough? Do you need another book to read? You should talk to the houndkeeper\u2019s apprentice, I think you could be friends.*\n\nThe Control loves Tabby. She\u2019s as fundamental to his world as the air he breathes. She\u2019s pretty, and she\u2019s young, and she gives a shit.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t put them on the windowsill again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr what about the bookshelf? Behind the Yeats? Last time they were behind the Yeats.\u201d\n\n\u201cTabby, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the pendant didn\u2019t help? Damn. I could make another pair but it will take a while. I don\u2019t have the proper glass. Maybe a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014A week,\u201d says the Control. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it yet, they\u2019ll turn up. I think I\u2019ve finally got a lead on the gremlins.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t, of course, but Tabby\u2019s face lights up and when she smiles it\u2019s okay to lie. It makes her happy to think that he\u2019s engaging with the world.\n\nThe horse outside whinnies again, and then the hounds start up, their ten-part chorus of howls, a song that\u2019s still cacophonous but in any case, they\u2019re singing and that\u2019s enough for what this is. Tabby bustles through the room. She peeks under the piles of books and clothes and old circus posters, unnerved as ever by the Bearded Lady, and though she doesn\u2019t find his glasses every stop sees another garment in her hands. A t-shirt here, a pair of blue jeans there.\n\nTabby wears a robe of midnight black cinched tight at the waist by a band of frozen starlight. Her hair is woven through with cloth of gold, and whenever she smiles the color twists to catch the light. A neat trick, if unusually reserved in these parts, these times.\n\nThe Control dresses behind a conjured screen, slipping Tabby\u2019s pendant into his pocket. When he\u2019s done she eyes him critically, smoothing a crease here, brushing stains off there. It takes a little longer every time, another thing that he appreciates.\n\nThe horse whinnies again. It stamps its foot, and the whole dressing room shakes. Tabby keeps him there another thirty seconds, and then it\u2019s time and there\u2019s nothing more that she can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you after?\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn the morning,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Control can\u2019t bear to see her, after.\n\nHe leaves Tabby at the door. She\u2019ll try and fail to straighten his room, her magic barely leaving in a dent a place that\u2019s become so thoroughly him. She\u2019ll leave a note on his pillow though, just a little something, a snippet of a poem perhaps, and he\u2019ll hold it for a while when he comes back. As the horse is locked into its traces, and they fly off into the sunset.\n\nThe Control steps out into the world. His dressing room is a carriage, mounted on heavy, bright painted wheels. The horse, Clyde, eyes him with steady, too-human annoyance. They both know he\u2019s late.\n\nThe Control walks through a world transformed. It\u2019s springtime, and the air is filled with pollen, dancing through the wind like crushed sapphires and emeralds, a thousand colors for a thousand different, construct species. A dizzying profusion that threatens to blot out the path without his glasses, but of course, the Control can\u2019t forget the path. Wherever they go, the camp is always built the same.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d says Asher. The Control nods. He stares at the ground, refusing to look up, and Asher takes his arm, half dragging him the rest of the way. They climb another short set of stairs, a door squeaks, and the Control is shoved in. The workday begins, and all he has is a wooden chair and four glass walls, a t-shirt, and blue jeans, and himself.\n\nThe Control sits in his glass cage and waits.\n\nSoon he hears the voices. Children and their parents. Gremlins. Couples out on bad first dates, thrill-seekers too jaded to ever find a thrill. They come too easy now, snap your fingers and watch the world change.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " Your story has a lot of potential, but there are a few areas that could use improvement.

Instead of simply telling us that the Control is a slight, unprepossessing man with long hair, try showing us through his actions and dialogue. What does he do that reveals his personality? What does he say that gives us a sense of who he is?\n\nIn addition, your story could benefit from a stronger plot. Right now, it feels a bit like a series of events strung together, without a clear purpose or goal. What is the conflict that the Control is trying to resolve? What is at stake if he fails?

{"prompt": "The stinking smell of alcohol, inaudible whispers and screams of electronic devices flooded my senses. A woman in medical mask and milk white uniform tapped several air bubbles out of a syringe. As she came close to me, giving me reassuring whispers like those across the room, I closed my glassy eyes and my mind wandered to several months before.\n\nThis time, all I could hear is clicking and typing sounds.\n\n\"Sun?\"\n\nI stopped my hands on the keyboards, and glanced swiftly beside my desk. It was Rey the Gnome, who was holding papers higher than her head and with a box of documents beside her. And...she was my superior officer.\n\n\"Well\u2014\" she massaged her temples and her gushy brows contracted into a terrible frown. \"I know that you are hard-working and to be honest, you are one of the best salesmen in my department.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But you are, how can I smooth it out? Unremarkable. You see? We sell Brooms for people to travel safely and Cartas for quick messages, but you can't perform any of this. HR has already requested a transfer of YOU to the Unremarkable Department.\"\n\n\"Please madam, I am sure there's another way.\" I sprang up to my feet, feeling blood rushing to my temples. People often labelled me as Unremarkable, Incapable, Broken and Failure. I spent more than half of my life proving myself, shifting jobs to jobs, seeking promotions and finally, landed to a normal life. \n\nThis cannot be the end of my life.\n\n\"And what is a normal life?\" She bitterly smiled.\n\nGnomes that were certified with Grade 9 could mind-read for a brief time, yet I didn't see that coming. My gaze descended to the ground, because deep in my heart I knew that day of falling down would always come. My fantasy of living, pretending to be a normal person would always burst into bubble. It was simply a matter of time. I packed my stuff in silence and briskly left the department. \n\n\"Welcome to Floor UG113.\" A small piece of blackboard with milk white handwriting stood quietly at the corner. The golden lift raise up and I was left inside a dark corridor. \n\n\"Hello?\" My voice echoed and twisted into a deep voice.\n\nSomeone clicked a switch, and the light bulbs along the corridor began to blink. They radiated a warm, subtle glow and unveiled the identity of the lighter.\n\n\"Ames!\" I couldn't believe my own eyes, as he was not only my best friend in college but also a missing ones. He went missing several years ago. His parents and I searched for him with no hope, the cops wouldn't cooperate and his company didn't answer. I thought...we lost him.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you here for many days. Well, what is today's date?\" He whispered.\n\n\"7th of May. Why are you whispering? What happened to you? Your parents and I\u2014\"\n\nHe put a finger on his mouth, and I lowered my voice. His left arm was attached to a Vacutainer, which I shuddered with the sight of it as his arm was bruised because of it.\n\n\"Follow me.\"\n\nAs we walked along the corridor, I gazed with sharp nerves. Not long after, I began to realize that the walls were actually made with raven black plastic sheets, and outside the corridor laid more than thousands of hospital beds. He led me to an empty bed and we sat side by side, while being surrounded by an immeasurable amount of beds. Some with people, some without. \n\nI glanced up and the ceiling was unseen as there was not enough illuminance provided by the light bulbs, which were fading away as the switch restored its original spot.\n\n\"This is where all the 'Unremarkables' come.\" He said.\n\n\"Oh shush.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not labelling us.\" Although the room was dimly lit, I could feel he clenched his eyes, as if withstanding an unbearable pain. \"You know we can never fit in this society right?\"\n\n\"I know.\" My voice cracked, head's down and heart ached.\n\n\"That's why I am here. This is a secret project associated with every guild, race...People gain freedom, privileges and happiness from magic, but many of them suffer as well. It could create the strongest nation, but it could also brew wars.

The syringe still glowed with the remaining liquid, dropped to the floor and bounced off, making a clinging sound. All I could grasp was the feeling of falling on the bed, handcuffs on both of my wrists attached to it and a Vacutainer was inserted into my left arm.\n\nA feeling of purpose flooded my chest, the ache gone away like wind in the early Spring. The screams and beeping sounds of a medically machine woke me up. \n\n\"What is today's date?\" \n\nNote: Opening scene was inspired by the Matrix, the setting was less fantasized then I intended but I'm just too tired to change it back. Decided to end it as a psychological thriller, although I originally thought to make the \"Unremarkable\" into Spy, which could have been a happy ending.

I was fixated on the intricate waving patterns in the leaves and metal arms of what appeared to be a florescent pumpkin. Was it light from the inner side of the leaves that projected the image into the orb? Which parts of the plant vibrate to make sound?        \n          \n I had become aware too late to preserve the magic, and suddenly all I saw was a dull orange melon amidst green vines, and poor old Professor Mackle. She's ready to retire now, judging from her disregard toward long-established distancing procedures, even walking right up to me. \"I -- ,\" and a long, deflated sigh followed. 700 years of life began to crease her face and calmed her spirit. \"I hope you didn't do that on purpose,\" she admonished. I shook my head. She nodded, \"That was a conversation that we could pick up only a mile away from the diviner's tower, before you had even thought of conquest.\"        \n     \n\"Is that the narrative, now?\" I asked immediately. I started seeing her remember.       \n        \n\"Right, while this tape, I mean this replication.....

I should not have spoken of flight.       \n       \n\"Right.\" Mrs. Mackle folded her arms on the table. She had strength in her yet; by her posture I remembered her power. \"And your.. apocalyptic crusade put an end to it. Now, \" She began to remember, \"I understand that Marvin has substantially altered all our understanding of events, but it was you that never disclosed why pushing back the invaders required such collateral damage.

They suddenly seemed so very far away. I wondered how large they must be to remain visible. I wondered how the winds and the sands could remain upon suspended rocks and I felt my power align the elements like never before. Caught up in a vision of my gifts' influence, I was forced to watch millions of our enemies become crushed by a force which threw them into the rocks. Millions more lost their breaths instantly when the winds were pulled with boundless force into the grasp of those massive lands beyond our world. Marvin saw it, too, as well as the king.

I couldn't free them if I tried.\"         \n            \nShe wondered, \"And still, your power strengthens. What exactly....\" She kept speaking, but I was distracted again. Alice had made the midday meal this time, and I could smell the meats as they cooked. I could hear her rattling pans and fussing with the children in the other room. It was calming. It made sense. If the meat contains many particulates, then it must be little parts of it drifting in the air that allow me to smell them. If they're particulates, then it's their little movements that must vibrate my ears. The insects and wind outside the window mingled with metal and the grunts of great beasts.         \n         \nElisabeth Mackle stopped talking to hear her envoy, as well, as they blissfully continued to prepare to kill me. Only their mage knew, for now, that their simple spell to mask sound and smell was the last that spell to ever be cast.       \n        \nMy old teacher followed me to my doorstep. \"Why don't you stop?

My head snapped towards every rustle of grass or crack of a twig that echoed through the dusk. The forest shimmered as a biting wind whistled through the undergrowth. I hastened my step. \n\nSlowly the darkness enveloped the path with only small pin pricks of moon light penetrating the thick foliage above. The hairs on my neck stood up as I whirled around.

Each step felt like an uphill battle where I was carrying a nets worth of fish back from shore. Damned side effects\u2026\n\nI felt my body swaying side to side. A slender prod caressed my arm.

She held out her broken hand. I grabbed it without thinking. Her skin was colder than the night itself. Her fingers clamped around my own wrist as the same cackle from earlier erupted from the girls lips. A much more sinister air about it.\n\nI tried to pull away as the young girls frown morphed into a smile. Her form slowly grew into a hulking, hunchback creature. Her once soft, childlike features were now jagged and bony. Her fingers clamped unbreakably around my arm.

For him, I was the one who would solve all his problems, but the poor soul hadn't a clue that I had no clue on how to proceed. There aren't exactly courses you go through when you become a genie.

A photo of Henry with his father in the corn fields, his mouth twisted in laughter, his Dad with his hand on Henry's back. A special moment shared between the two was no captured for all eternity. \n\nIs this what eternity feels like?\n\n\"I will rip it out.\" I said, as I reached Henry. I pushed my hands through his chest, and they slid right in.\n\nI fiddled around a little, and finally felt a big mass, a mass that shouldn't have been there.

{"prompt": "The oracle stared back at me, blank-faced and dim. This was going to be a long night.\n\nOracles were known for being unreliable before we forgot how to use them, and these days almost none of them still worked. This one had not been woken for some time; dust clogged its every surface when I'd started work on it, well over a week ago.\n\nThis was a larger specimen, headless, with many redundant organs, and lacking many of the appendages usually afforded to an oracle, despite having the necessary orifices for them to link into.

The site had been discovered a decade ago in the arctic, as humans migrated to colder areas of the world to escape the rising temperatures. The site itself was modest, simple structures and infrastructure apparently designed specifically for housing oracles of this kind. Red tape, politics and the usual theological fretting common to our species prevented any research expeditions from occurring until now.\n\nSince being permitted onto the site, we had devoted a week to cleaning, cataloguing and studying each of the oracles housed here. There were well over 50 specimens. And yet still, I took the greatest of care in my attempts to repair this first one.\n\n\"FUUUCK!!!\" I growled. This was the seventh time I had tried to kickstart it, to no avail. In other circumstances, I'd have written the machine off, but this was everything. According to the texts they had found onsite, this oracle was special; it was the master oracle which the other 49 depend on for full functioning, apparently. Its respiratory system remained entirely inert.\n\nI had only one thing left to try. From my orocologists bag, I withdrew a small rubber percussive device. After what was probably not enough hesitation, I gave each of the organs a light whack.

In particular, I would have liked to see more of the protagonist's internal conflict and struggle with the implications of the lottery win.\n\nOverall, I felt that the story had potential but needed more development in order to truly shine."}
{"prompt": "\"What do you mean 'slight technical error'?\" Katie was livid. \"Jesus, Marty, I leave this office for 2 minutes to run a diagnostic and you revert his sequence back by 70 million years?\" \n\nThe small primate slapped his tiny hands against the glass wall of the chamber, as the two scientists loomed over him with concerned expressions. \n\nAlthough he was now unable to comprehend much of his situation, Alan still had enough sense left in his brain to be in a state of sheer panic. He screamed in a voice that made the scientists recoil on instinct. It just sounded ancient and dangerous. \n\nMarty, the scientist on the right, wrung his hands nervously. Sweat was cascading down his forehead as he fretted, watching his colleague for some cue, any cue, on how he should proceed. \"I don't know what happened! One second the sequences are adapting to the instructions, and then the computers all freeze the next and he starts growing fur!\" \n\nThe head scientist swept a lock of hair out of her face, eyes focused on their unfortunate test subject. \"He looks like some sort of early primate.\" \n\n\"Some sort of relative to Plesiadapis?\" Marty hesitantly offered, starting as the little primate gave the glass another round of futile whacks with his palms. His little teeth were bared in what resembled a primitive smile, but was more likely a promise of death and destruction on the scientists and their families. \n\nKatie turned away and leaned over one of the countless computer monitors adorning the lab, her hands gliding through the more advanced controls and pulling up the relevant window. She \"hrmm\"ed distractedly, glancing back and forth between an artist's rendering and what she presumed to be the real thing. \"It's a pretty close match, visually, but if you're wrong, we might end up mucking up his genome and creating a whole new species of hominid.\" \n\nMarty laughed nervously. \"Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?\" \n\nHe was met with a blank, intentional stare from Katie. \"You know I'm gonna have to file a report about this, Marty. Not a good look for you.\" \n\nMarty's shoulders sagged in defeat, smile vanishing. \"I know.\" \n\n\"Do you? Do you also know that the whole department is going to suffer from this if word gets out?\" Katie massaged her temples as she continued to watch Alan's furtive attempts to escape. \"Those journalists are going to tear everything to shreds. Our research, our reputation- Fuck!\" \n\nThis time, it was Alan who ended up jumping backwards, as Katie slammed her first down on the tabletop, displacing several trays of pens and various measuring tools. She ignored the agitated chattering of the primate, opting to give Marty one disappointed look before turning to go. \"I can't believe you could be so careless.\"\n\n\"Careless?!\" Marty wasn't usually one to talk back, especially when an error had occured under his supervision. He was usually a responsible (if not annoyingly nervous) employee, but something about the stupid monkey's screaming finally set him off. \n\n\"How can you just assume it was because I was careless and that's it, story over, I'm the only one responsible for- for this?!\" He swept his hand in Alan's direction, illiciting an encore of desperate chittering and screeching behind the glass. \"How can you do that and call yourself a scientist?\" \n\nKatie didn't even bother to give him the satisfaction of being shocked at his outburst. She didn't even look at him. \"Oh, grow up and take some fucking accountability. This happened under YOUR management, after YOU tinkered with the system- don't you dare turn around and try to guilt me so you can feel better about your mistakes and their consequences. Someone has to take the fall for this, and it sure as hell isn't going to be me.\" \n\nSilence fell over the lab at this, but Katie didn't care. She was fully prepared to leave some instructions for the animal's care when she'd had a second to clear her head and accept the reality that all of their work might have just vanished with Alan's higher brain functions. \n\nBut something stopped Katie from leaving; the sound of a grate sliding open behind her. The sound froze her blood, and she whipped around so fast it hurt her neck. She only had a moment to take in the scene in front of her before Alan's teeth were fastened into her collarbone. \n\nMarty, his face grim, had opened the door to Alan's chamber. He watched the Plesiadapis' trajectory until it collided with his coworker. As soon as Katie's screams joined Alan's, Marty quickly backed away from the scene and bolted through the emergency exit at the back of the lab. He reached for his phone and quickly punched in a few numbers. \"This is Dr. Clarke, we have a security breach in lab 004! Initiate a lockdown of the whole floor, NOW!\" \n\nAs the red lights came on and the alarm began to blare, Marty breathed a sigh of relief, knowing he'd just avoided a catastrophe.\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The opening of this story is very strong, it immediately grabs the reader's attention and draws them into the conflict. I like the way you use dialogue to establish the characters and their relationships to one another. However, there are a few areas where the dialogue feels a bit stilted and unnatural. I would recommend reading it aloud to yourself to see how it sounds and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nI also found the ending to be very abrupt and unsatisfying. It feels like there should be more resolution, especially since the conflict was resolved so quickly. I would recommend adding a few more sentences to wrap up the story and tie up any loose ends."}
{"prompt": "The Collection of Consciousnesses called Golbur sat on their crystal throne peering through the stream of the N-dimensional simulation. A steady stream of glitches pinged against their mindscape. Golbur bent the simulation into an isolation torus and slowed the stream until a single glitch was visible. They paused it. \"Gotcha.\"\n\nGolbur pulled the offending simulacra into reality. A small mammalian, mostly hairless and covered in a tight neoprene covering. One of Yahweh's silly little inclusions in the sim. An accompanying information stream indicated that it was designated Julia. Golbur switched to it's language.\n\n\"What Were You Doing?\"\n\nThe Julia creature looked around at the room, the walls of which were beyond the limits of her sight. \"What the hell just happened? This isn't Alpha Centauri. Where's my ship?\"\n\n\"Focus, Creature. We Will Know You.\" Golbur pinned Julia's gaze onto themself.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. \u2014 Sea Urchin? Are you talking to me? Your spines are being all shifty.\" She kept trying to look elsewhere.\n\nGolbur extruded an avatar into her dimension. \"Look at me. Is this better?\"\n\n\"Oh, now you just look like me. Except for the mustache. Ready to tell me what's going on?\"\n\nGolbur waved one of her hands and a small image of a starship floated between them. \"You were on this vessel? Commanding it, yes?\"\n\n\"The Starskipper. Yes, we'd just made the jump to Alpha Centauri.\"\n\nGolbur grimaced, a facial contortion that she decided that she liked. \"But previously you were in the Sol system? An entirely different loading zone. Traveling between the two systems is supposed to take 5 years. The time lag allows the simulation to load in needed assets. How did you get there so fast?\"\n\nJulia smiled. \"Skip drive. You shove a singularity inside the corona of a star and the universe freaks out, skips you somewhere else. Even the nerd squad can't work out the math for why it works, but it does.\"\n\n\"It's not supposed to work that way. You're using a glitch to speedrun to another star?\" Julia nodded eagerly.\n\nGolbur paused Julia and reran the relevant part of the simulation. \"Crap. It repros. I'm not going to be able to fix this in a single sprint.\"\n\nGolbur unpaused Julia. \"I don't suppose I'll be able to convince you humans to just stop doing it?\"\n\nJulia laughed. \"The skip drive is the basis for the Human Empire. We'd never give it up.\"\n\nGolbur waved a hand and Julia popped out of existence, then they reverted back to their true form. They peered across the vast dimensions of the simulation. Despite the glitches, it was still running.\n\n\"Screw it, we'll call it a feature.\"\n\n\\[More writing at r/c_avery_m\\]\n\n PROFESSIONAL FEEDBACK: ", "completion": " The first thing I noticed in your story is that you have a lot of interesting ideas, and you certainly have a unique writing style. That being said, there are a few areas where I think you could improve.\n\nFirst, I would recommend being more concise in your writing. There are a few places where you could cut out unnecessary words or phrases. For example, in the second paragraph, you could cut out the phrase \"one of Yahweh's silly little inclusions in the sim.\" This doesn't really add anything to the story, and it interrupts the flow of the sentence.\n\nSecond, I would recommend being more specific in your descriptions. In the third paragraph, you describe the Julia creature as \"mostly hairless and covered in a tight neoprene covering.\" This is a bit vague and could be more specific. For example, you could say \"The Julia creature was mostly hairless, with a few patches of fur on its body. It was wearing a tight neoprene covering.\"\n\nOverall, I think you have a lot of potential as a writer. I really enjoyed reading your story, and I'm looking forward to reading more of your work in the future."}
{"prompt": "\"That's impossible, Two,\" Operator One whispered in hushed tones. \"There's only three Operators with edit access.\"\n\n\"I thought the same 'till an hour ago,\" Operator Two replied. \"One, take a look at this.\"\n\nThe duo stood in a nondescript park, littered with trees and paths and greenery. Two pointed towards the nearest tree. \"The tree bark,\" she said. \"Take a look.\"\n\nOne stared at the tree for a few moments before replying, \"That's\u2026 not tree bark. Wait, is it moving?\" The not-bark was indeed moving; like syrup, it was melting down the sides of the tree in a gradual advance towards the ground.\n\n\"It gets weirder,\" Two continued. She glanced round to check for humans then snapped her fingers. At once, a holo-display appeared in front of them. \"Search for known glitches in the logs.\"\n\nOne looked confused as he concentrated on the display. The holo-display responded to the unspoken query with a short list. \"Few thousand,\" One muttered. \"But that's harmless. They're all visual glitches. We patched out anything dangerous eons ago.\"\n\n\"Search again,\" Two replied, \"But not for glitches. Look for anything similar to the tree.\"\n\n\"Right\u2026\" One said. He looked at the tree and closed his eyes. Opening them, he gasped as he looked at the list on the display.\u00a0\n\n\"What the fuck?\" One cried. \"8.6 Quintillion?!\"\u00a0\n\nTwo looked haggard as she responded, \"Yeah. I know.\"\n\n\"Why haven't you told Three?\"\u00a0\n\n\"You know what they're like. They'll get mad and blame me. You've got more experience so I asked you first. And I-\" Two sighed. \"I don't know what's happening.\"\n\nOne looked as if he was about to pass out. \"You don't know. You don't know why 8.6 quintillion edits were made and none of them were recorded as glitches?\"\u00a0\n\n\"No.\"\n\nOne let out a sigh. \"Let's take a closer look.\"\n\nThe Operators walked up to the tree and One peered at it with a discerning eye. \"This looks like something I'd make when I was new to the job,\" he said. \"It's poor work. I'd have failed a trainee Operator in an instant for it.\"\n\nTwo suppressed a smile. \"Like the time I sent that meteor towards Earth by accident?\"\u00a0\n\nOne rolled his eyes. \"Ugh. Don't remind me. That incident paperwork took weeks to file.\" He hovered a hand over the melting tree. \"Why show me this edit in particular?\"\u00a0\n\n\"It's the first one made,\" Two replied. \"And as you said, it's bad. Figured whoever did this was sloppy. Left clues. Right?\"\n\n\"Good thinking,\" One said. He brought the holo-display over to him with the flick of a hand. \"Edit author,\" He muttered to himself, \"Authorisation level, counter-signer and date of-what?\"\u00a0\n\nTwo glanced over. \"What?\"\u00a0\n\n\"It's one author. All of the edits are from one author.\"\n\nTwo blinked. \"Impossible.\"\n\nOne was now frantically checking logs and making secondary searches. \"There's no way. Oh- oh. This is bad. Real bad.\" He looked up at Two, fear evident in his eyes. \"We need to leave.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\"\u00a0\n\n\"It's not an Operator doing this.\"\n\n\"Then who?\" Two asked.\u00a0\n\n\"It's a human.\"\n\nSuddenly, the holo-display in front of Two duplicated itself. Then again to make four; then again and again and again, until there was a wall of screens stretching into the sky and as far as the eye could see.\n\n\"Too late,\" a tinny voice echoed from the original display.\u00a0\n\nA woman had appeared on the display, grinning at the Operators with eyes like black holes; her lips curled back further to reveal an impossible number of teeth. One by one, each screen became static then was replaced by the same grinning woman.\u00a0\n\n\"Well, that was easy. I knew whoever created all this'd investigate. Found you,\" she hissed.\n\n\"Run!\" One shouted. He grabbed at Two's hand and dragged her back from the spectacle of screens.\n\nThen, everything was plunged into darkness as the sun in the sky disappeared.\n\n~\n\n(I write many things.

{"prompt": "It has been over 40 years since symptoms first manifested. *They* have been unrelenting in their purge. I have lost friends, families, loved ones, but still I carried on with my work. It is the only thing I have left now.\n\nIt was by pure chance that I discovered *them*, their existence floated to the surface in a sea of equations too turbulent to explain in words. Priests and clergymen speak of intelligent design, incorrectly pointing to flawed evidence of a greater being, but ignorantly blind to the real proof hiding in the mathematics of the physical laws all around us. Only an intelligent mind with concrete goals could design a system so flawlessly interlinked.\n\nNo one would believe me. The general populace wouldn't even be able to understand what I was trying to explain. I had to expand the understanding of the human race before I could begin to free us from the shackles binding our free will.

No, they had to make my death likely, believable, and acceptable. And I was slowly losing the ability to continue my work, it was a terrifically efficient method of killing two birds with one stone.\n\nFortunately, I had time before the full extent of my curse manifested. I spent the first year building a robot servant that I named Jane. She has since become a vital part of my journey into the unknown. I cannot count the number of times she has saved my life.

Sometimes I felt I almost succeeded, but the quantum wave fluctuations would collapse and I would be brought back to square 1. The line between success and failure is often an unsurmountable wall despite its paper thin thickness. \n\nI alone am not enough, I don't have much time left. There is only one way to save ourselves: I need to gather those capable of carrying the burden of my work, from across all time and space.\n\nLet this memoir be a record of my journey and struggle.
