I am a creative writing expert. I have been a professional editor for 30 years. I am going to read the following short story and provide you critical feedback to improve your prose. I will hold you to the highest literary standards, and my feedback will be open-ended and include examples or suggestions. I will also commend you where you did well.



STORY:
================================

Every day I drink to the point that I can tolerate being around the fools around me. Not that I do.

Wizards? They are more like kittens playing around with yarn--it would be impossible to make them understand that what they're playing around with was not created solely for the purpose of their entertainment. As for me, I am different. I need to know where magic comes from, and I need to understand how it ended up in Stokacenor.

I uncork another bottle, swiggle it around a little to wake up its contents, and I gorge myself with its contents. If it doesn't burn, you aren't drinking. You have to throw yourself into it with wild abandon because that is how you must face all things if you are to become the greatest wizard the world has ever seen. The smash of the bottle against the wall is a lovely sound. "Sifieridum Maloceotris!" The shards of glass reassemble themselves, hovering up into the air; the reflected light from the moon is visible in them to my great delight. I clear my throat. "Chivborodum Magnisodesis!" A sweet glug, glug, glug as the bottle fills. A red delight! All mine! Wine is a wonder and an unlimited supply of it? It almost makes it worth it, having put up with those insufferable scrotums prancing about in the 'Academy.'

The bottle hovers towards me and I stick out my tongue but my eyes are fastened on the page of the book in front of me. It's an old one. I had to break out Tier 5 magic just to make it somewhat readable. But its contents are all knew to me. 'The Heroic Struggles of Durn Blurn,' said the title and I scratched my long beard for a long while before deciding to check it out. That is another of my fine qualities: I search where others have not. So I learn what others never will.

&gt; Durn Blurn was once an eyelash drifting around in the emptiness of space. Eons earlier he had fallen from his brethren comprising the left brow of the great Sacter. Durn Blurn drifted, and drifted, and drifted, until he fell into a rift. That rift was a portal to Stokacenor.

I let drops of wine fall onto my tongue and I sip them up much like how a cat would. Sacter? The Initial Being? I have never heard this story before.

&gt; Durn Blurn did not at first understand the world he had landed in. Where was all the magic?

A ripple of delight flashes through me. Now we're getting somewhere!

&gt; "Magic not be in here place?" asked Durn Blurn. "But of reason why?" He eyelashed all through the realm, seeing strange sights, and he came to realize that he had ended up a magic-free pocket of existence. Durn Blurn decided he would change things. "Be magic," he said and Stokacenor was transformed. He thought for a long time before deciding on some spells. First, he invented Blogorandium Sifarilosi. "Upside time," he said.

... What? Blogorandium Sifarilosi is a Tier 3 levitation spell.

&gt; Durn Blurn levitated across the realm until he stumbled on a little girl crying. "What tears about?" he wondered. He then saw a broken cup. Ah; entropy. A familiar scourge. Durn Blurn sagely created a spell to mend the problem, "Not broke." We know it better, of course, as Sifieridum Maloceotris.

This is strange stuff. For a moment I just stare at the pages. I turn my head to see that I have spilled my wine on the floor of my study. "Sifieridum Malo--"

It feels ... strange. This book cannot be true, can it? Am I supposed to be believe these great spells have stupid meanings like that? And they were invented by an ... eyelash?

I cast the spell and the wine slurps its way back into the bottle. I feel uneasy.

&gt; Durn Blurn wanted to know about the problems of these strange creatures, so he created the spell Mifieroaenis Cilorefhax Bh'o. "Durn Blurn time," he said. Any creature wishing to consult him could do so using the spell. Durn Blurn felt very pleased with himself.

Maybe I would try it out, just as a joke? I looked around. No one's here. I opened my door. No one there either. I looked out the window. All clear. It's not silly if I'm just doing it as a joke. "Mifieroaenis Cilorefax Bh'o!"

As I expected, nothing happened. Of course. What was I thinking? This was just a book written for amusement, which was why no one but me had bothered to read it. I wasted my time with the most stupid things! Why didn't I just spend this day procrastinating instead?

"Durn Blurn time?"

The most hideous man I had ever laid my eyes on stood right before me. I screamed.

"No big ear sounds. Durn Blurn sensitive ears. Small sound better."

The grotesque creature before me ... Could it be? Was it truly ...?

"Durn Blurn book! Very of good reading." The man made a wild grimace and gave me two thumbs up. He laughed. "Shocked why so handsome?" The beast *pouted*. "Be so handsome spell," he explained.

"Chivborodum Magnisodesis!" I cried. I was going to need more wine. Much more wine.
